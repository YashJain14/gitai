## Project Overview

GitAI is a project aimed at assisting developers in learning and using Git commands effectively. We've explored various approaches, including:

1. Fine-tuned LLMs 
2. CLI Native AI Agent 
3. Commonly Used Commands Retrieval system
4. RAG QA Bot 

Each approach has its strengths, and we're continually working to improve and integrate these solutions.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Set up the development environment 
## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to GitAI:

1. Improving existing models and systems
2. Adding new features or approaches
3. Enhancing documentation
4. Fixing bugs
5. Writing tests
6. Providing feedback and suggestions

Before starting work on a major feature or change, please open an issue to discuss it with the maintainers.

## Contribution Areas
