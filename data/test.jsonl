Thus I'm still using the one-liner in my original answer to get MR info in a CI job.\n\nOriginal answer:\nNo.\nBut GitLab have a plan for this feature in 2019 Q2: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/23902#final-assumptions\nCurrently, we can use a workaround to achieve this. The method is as Rekovni's answer described, and it actually works.\nThere's a simple one-liner, get the target branch of an MR from the current branch:\nscript: # in any script section of gitlab-ci.yml\n  - 'CI_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME=$(curl -LsS -H \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: $AWESOME_GITLAB_API_TOKEN\" \"https://my.gitlab-instance.com/api/v4/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/merge_requests?source_branch=$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME\" | jq --raw-output \".[0].target_branch\")'\n\nExplanation:\nCI_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME is a newly defined variable which stores resolved target branch name. Defining a variable is not necessary for various usage.\nAWESOME_GITLAB_API_TOKEN is the variable configured in repository's CI/CD variable config. It is a GitLab personal access token(created in User Settings) with api scope.\nAbout curl options: -L makes curl aware of HTTP redirections. -sS makes curl silent(-s) but show(-S) errors. -H specifies authority info accessing GitLab API.\nThe used API could be founded in https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/merge_requests.html#list-project-merge-requests. We use the source_branch attribute to figure out which MR current pipeline is running on. Thus, if a source branch has multiple MR to different target branch, you may want to change the part after | and do your own logic.\nAbout jq(https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), it's a simple CLI util to deal with JSON stuff(what GitLab API returns).

How can I do that?\nIssuing the below command partially works, but it shows the diff of the new changes of my local branch too.\ngit diff remote/branch"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since this topic comes up frequently, and can be confusing without a bit of background on how git works, I thought I'd try to explain the simplest case possible, but with sufficient depth that newcomers will have enough of a handle on it to do additional research.\nIf you set up your git repository via a normal 'clone' and have the default refspecs, meaning that your remote is named 'origin' and you pull/fetch from the branch 'master', you may sometimes need to see what's in the remote repository before pulling it down.\nSince the \"git pull\" does an automatic merge (unless there are conflicts), it can be nice to see what's \"incoming\" next.   If you're not familiar with how git works, and how refspecs in particular are managed, this can be a bit non-intuitive.  \nSuppose someone makes a change in the remote repository (for sake of illustration, adding a line to the remote repository by committing a change and pushing it), and you type:\n$ git diff origin/master\n\nYou probably won't see any changes; however if you do the following:\n$ git fetch; git diff ..origin/master \n\nyou'll see the difference between what's been committed to your local git repository and what's in the remote repository.  You will NOT see any changes which are in your local filesystem or staged in your index.   \nOk, why do we do this?  origin/master is a refspec (see man pages).  In short, this is what we refer to in order to compare against, pull or fetch from, and push to.   All of the following are functionally equivalent:\norigin/master\nremotes/origin/master\nrefs/remotes/origin/master\n\nTo begin to untangle this, just take a peek at your repository's .git directory structure.  A typical layout looks like this:\n.git/refs\n.git/refs/heads\n.git/refs/heads/master\n.git/refs/remotes\n.git/refs/remotes/origin\n.git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD\n.git/refs/remotes/origin/master\n.git/refs/tags\n\nLook at .git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD; in the default case it will point to the branch you use to pull from and push to.  In my case, since I'm on master, the contents of this text file look like this:\nref: refs/remotes/origin/master\n\nThis tells me that the HEAD of my remote is identified by the refspec 'refs/remotes/origin/master'(which happens to have the aliases mentioned above).\nThis doesn't tell us much; what's the state of the remote repository?  Look at the state of the remote master: \n$ cat .git/refs/heads/master     \n6d0fb0adfdfa5af861931bb06d34100b349f1d63\n\nOk, it's a SHA1 hash; probably a commit.  How does it get put in this file?  Well, whenever you do a pull or a fetch, this file is updated with the most recent commit from the remote which was pulled or fetched.  This explains why we have to git fetch prior to performing the diff.  Remember, git fetch just updates your local copy of a remote branch, but doesn't merge it with your working copy.  It is completely safe. A git fetch; git merge is equivalent to a git pull.  \nOnce you do the fetch, git will be able to see the most recent commit in the remote \nrepository as of the time of the fetch.\nYou can use various combinations of specifiers to git to see your diffs as you desire (the following examples use the local working copy as the implicit first commit):\n$ git diff remote/origin   \nThis shows the incoming remote additions as deletions; any additions in your local \nrepository are shown as additions.\n\n$ git diff ...remote/origin\nShows incoming remote additions as additions; the triple-dot excludes changes\ncommitted to your local repository.\n\n$ git diff ..remote/origin\nShows incoming remote additions as additions; the double-dot includes changes\ncommitted to your local repository as deletions (since they are not yet pushed).\n\nFor info on \"..\" vs \"...\" see git help diff as well as the excellent documentation at git-scm revision selection: commit ranges  Briefly, for the examples above, double-dot syntax shows all commits reachable from origin/master but not your working copy.  Likewise, the triple-dot syntax shows all the commits reachable from either commit (implicit working copy, remote/origin) but not from both.\nI'm going through this step by step because I'm fairly new to git and this is exactly the type of thing that had me confused... I'm sure that git experts can find flaws with the details... I just hope this answer bridges the gap for some people who find all the various posts a bit terse."}]}

So in your local repository you can have your git-svn clone and push changes out to GitHub. Git doesn't care. If you create your git-svn clone and push the exact same changes out to GitHub, you'll have an unofficial mirror of the Google Code repository. The rest is vanilla Git.\ngit svn clone http://example.googlecode.com/svn -s\ngit remote add origin [email\u00a0protected]:example/example.git\ngit push origin master\n\nNow that you have this, occasionally you will have to synchronise the Subversion repository with Git. It'll look something like:\ngit svn rebase\ngit push\n\nIn gitk or whatever, this would look something like this:\no [master][remotes/trunk][remotes/origin/master]\n|\no\n|\no\n\nAnd when you run git svn rebase, you would have this:\no [master][remotes/trunk]\n|\no\n|\no [remotes/origin/master]\n|\no\n|\no\n\nSo now running git push would push those commits out to GitHub, the [remotes/origin/master] branch there. And you'd be back to the scenario in the first ASCII art diagram.\nThe problem now is, how do you work your changes into the mix? The idea is, you don't ever commit onto the same branch that you are git-svn-rebase-ing and git-pushing. You need a separate branch for your changes. Otherwise, you would end up rebasing your changes on top of the Subversion ones, which could upset anyone who clones your Git repository. Follow me? OK, so you create a branch, let's call it \"features\". And you make a commit and push it out to GitHub to the features branch. Your gitk would look something like this:\no [features][remotes/origin/features]\n|\no\n|\no [master][remotes/trunk][remotes/origin/master]\n|\no\n\nHere you've got your features branch a couple of commits ahead of the Google Code branch, right? So what happens when you want to incorporate new stuff from Google Code? You'd run git svn rebase first and get this:\n                           o [features][remotes/origin/features]\n[master][remotes/trunk] o  |\n                        |  o\n                        o /\n                        |/\n                        o[remotes/origin/master]\n                        |\n                        o\n\nIf you git push master out, you can imagine the [remotes/origin/master] being at the same point as master. But your feature branch doesn't have the changes. Your choices now are to merge master into features, or rebase features. A merge would look like this\ngit checkout features\ngit merge master \n\n            o [features]\n           /|\n          / o [remotes/origin/features]\n[master] o  |\n         |  o\n         o /\n         |/\n         o\n         |\n         o\n\nThen you push features out to GitHub. I've left off the remotes for master to save space, they'd be at the same point as [master].\nThe rebase approach is slightly more evil - you'd have to push with --force as your push would not be a fast-forward merge (you'd pull the features branch from under someone who had cloned it). It's not really considered OK to do this, but nobody can stop you if you are determined. It does make some things easier too, such as when patches get accepted upstream in slightly reworked form. It'd save having to mess about with conflicts, you can just rebase --skip the upstreamed patches. Anyway, a rebase would be like this:\ngit rebase master features\n\n         o [features]\n         |\n         o\n         |  o [remotes/origin/features]\n[master] o  |\n         |  o\n         o /\n         |/\n         o\n         |\n         o\n\nAnd then you would have to git push --force that. You can see why you need to force it, the history has a big old schism from the [remotes/origin/features] to the new current post-rebase [features].\nThis all works, but it is a lot of effort. If you are going to be a regular contributor, the best bet would be to work like this for a while, send some patches upstream and see if you can get commit access to Subversion. Failing that, perhaps don't push your changes out to GitHub. Keep them local and try and get them accepted upstream anyway."}]}

Otherwise\nit remains on the current branch. If <upstream> is not specified, the upstream configured in branch.<name>.remote and branch.<name>.merge options will be used (see git-config for details) and the --fork-point option is\nassumed.  If you are currently not on any branch or if the current\nbranch does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will abort. All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not\nin <upstream> are saved to a temporary area.  This is the same set\nof commits that would be shown by git log <upstream>..HEAD ; or by git log 'fork_point'..HEAD , if --fork-point is active (see the\ndescription on --fork-point below); or by git log HEAD , if the --root option is specified. The current branch is reset to <upstream> or <newbase> if the --onto option was supplied.  This has the exact same effect as git reset --hard <upstream> (or <newbase> ). ORIG_HEAD is set\nto point at the tip of the branch before the reset. Note ORIG_HEAD is not guaranteed to still point to the previous branch tip\nat the end of the rebase if other commands that write that pseudo-ref\n(e.g. git reset ) are used during the rebase. The previous branch tip,\nhowever, is accessible using the reflog of the current branch\n(i.e. @{1} , see gitrevisions ). The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area are\nthen reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order. Note that\nany commits in HEAD which introduce the same textual changes as a commit\nin HEAD..<upstream> are omitted (i.e., a patch already accepted upstream\nwith a different commit message or timestamp will be skipped). It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from being\ncompletely automatic.  You will have to resolve any such merge failure\nand run git rebase --continue .  Another option is to bypass the commit\nthat caused the merge failure with git rebase --skip .  To check out the\noriginal <branch> and remove the .git/rebase-apply working files, use\nthe command git rebase --abort instead. Assume the following history exists and the current branch is \"topic\": A---B---C topic\n         /\n    D---E---F---G master From this point, the result of either of the following commands: git rebase master\ngit rebase master topic would be: A'--B'--C' topic\n                 /\n    D---E---F---G master NOTE: The latter form is just a short-hand of git checkout topic followed by git rebase master . When rebase exits topic will\nremain the checked-out branch. If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made (e.g.,\nbecause you mailed a patch which was applied upstream), then that commit\nwill be skipped and warnings will be issued (if the merge backend is\nused).  For example, running git rebase master on the following\nhistory (in which A' and A introduce the same set of changes, but\nhave different committer information): A---B---C topic\n         /\n    D---E---A'---F master will result in: B'---C' topic\n                  /\n    D---E---A'---F master Here is how you would transplant a topic branch based on one\nbranch to another, to pretend that you forked the topic branch\nfrom the latter branch, using rebase --onto . First let\u2019s assume your topic is based on branch next .\nFor example, a feature developed in topic depends on some\nfunctionality which is found in next . o---o---o---o---o  master\n         \\\n          o---o---o---o---o  next\n                           \\\n                            o---o---o  topic We want to make topic forked from branch master ; for example,\nbecause the functionality on which topic depends was merged into the\nmore stable master branch. We want our tree to look like this: o---o---o---o---o  master\n        |            \\\n        |             o'--o'--o'  topic\n         \\\n          o---o---o---o---o  next We can get this using the following command: git rebase --onto master next topic Another example of --onto option is to rebase part of a\nbranch.  If we have the following situation: H---I---J topicB\n                           /\n                  E---F---G  topicA\n                 /\n    A---B---C---D  master then the command git rebase --onto master topicA topicB would result in: H'--I'--J'  topicB\n                /\n                | E---F---G  topicA\n                |/\n    A---B---C---D  master This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA. A range of commits could also be removed with rebase.  If we have\nthe following situation: E---F---G---H---I---J  topicA then the command git rebase --onto topicA~5 topicA~3 topicA would result in the removal of commits F and G: E---H'---I'---J'  topicA This is useful if F and G were flawed in some way, or should not be\npart of topicA.  Note that the argument to --onto and the <upstream> parameter can be any valid commit-ish. In case of conflict, git rebase will stop at the first problematic commit\nand leave conflict markers in the tree.  You can use git diff to locate\nthe markers (<<<<<<) and make edits to resolve the conflict.  For each\nfile you edit, you need to tell Git that the conflict has been resolved,\ntypically this would be done with git add <filename> After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the\ndesired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with git rebase --continue Alternatively, you can undo the git rebase with git rebase --abort"}]}

See git-config . Here\u2019s where things get tricky and more specific. The pruning feature\ndoesn\u2019t actually care about branches, instead it\u2019ll prune local \u2190\u2192\nremote-references as a function of the refspec of the remote (see <refspec> and CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES above). Therefore if the refspec for the remote includes\ne.g. refs/tags/*:refs/tags/* , or you manually run e.g. git fetch\n--prune <name> \"refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\" it won\u2019t be stale remote\ntracking branches that are deleted, but any local tag that doesn\u2019t\nexist on the remote. This might not be what you expect, i.e. you want to prune remote <name> , but also explicitly fetch tags from it, so when you fetch\nfrom it you delete all your local tags, most of which may not have\ncome from the <name> remote in the first place. So be careful when using this with a refspec like refs/tags/*:refs/tags/* , or any other refspec which might map\nreferences from multiple remotes to the same local namespace. Since keeping up-to-date with both branches and tags on the remote is\na common use-case the --prune-tags option can be supplied along with --prune to prune local tags that don\u2019t exist on the remote, and\nforce-update those tags that differ. Tag pruning can also be enabled\nwith fetch.pruneTags or remote.<name>.pruneTags in the config. See git-config . The --prune-tags option is equivalent to having refs/tags/*:refs/tags/* declared in the refspecs of the remote. This\ncan lead to some seemingly strange interactions: # These both fetch tags\n$ git fetch --no-tags origin 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'\n$ git fetch --no-tags --prune-tags origin The reason it doesn\u2019t error out when provided without --prune or its\nconfig versions is for flexibility of the configured versions, and to\nmaintain a 1=1 mapping between what the command line flags do, and\nwhat the configuration versions do. It\u2019s reasonable to e.g. configure fetch.pruneTags=true in ~/.gitconfig to have tags pruned whenever git fetch --prune is\nrun, without making every invocation of git fetch without --prune an error. Pruning tags with --prune-tags also works when fetching a URL\ninstead of a named remote. These will all prune tags not found on\norigin: $ git fetch origin --prune --prune-tags\n$ git fetch origin --prune 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'\n$ git fetch <url-of-origin> --prune --prune-tags\n$ git fetch <url-of-origin> --prune 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'"}]}

The differences between the transfer protocols used by Git are explained in the link below.)\nIf you want to change the URL of origin, you can just do:\ngit remote set-url origin [email\u00a0protected]:my_user_name/my_repo.git\n\nor\ngit remote set-url origin https://github.com/my_user_name/my_repo.git\n\nMore information is available in 10.6 Git Internals - Transfer Protocols."}]}

Is it like Git?\nIs there technical documentation describing how replication between two Couches works?\nWhat is the basic overview of CouchDB replication? What are some noteworthy characteristics about it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unfortunately there is no detailed documentation describing the replication protocol. There is only the reference implementation built into CouchDB, and Filipe Manana's rewrite of the same which will probably become the new implmentation in the future.\nHowever, this is the general idea:\nKey points\nIf you know Git, then you know how Couch replication works. Replicating is very similar to pushing or pulling with distributed source managers like Git.\nCouchDB replication does not have its own protocol. A replicator simply connects to two DBs as a client, then reads from one and writes to the other. Push replication is reading the local data and updating the remote DB; pull replication is vice versa.\n\nFun fact 1: The replicator is actually an independent Erlang application, in its own process. It connects to both couches, then reads records from one and writes them to the other.\nFun fact 2: CouchDB has no way of knowing who is a normal client and who is a replicator (let alone whether the replication is push or pull). It all looks like client connections. Some of them read records. Some of them write records.\n\nEverything flows from the data model\nThe replication algorithm is trivial, uninteresting. A trained monkey could design it. It's simple because the cleverness is the data model, which has these useful characteristics:\n\nEvery record in CouchDB is completely independent of all others. That sucks if you want to do a JOIN or a transaction, but it's awesome if you want to write a replicator. Just figure out how to replicate one record, and then repeat that for each record.\nLike Git, records have a linked-list revision history. A record's revision ID is the checksum of its own data. Subsequent revision IDs are checksums of: the new data, plus the revision ID of the previous.\nIn addition to application data ({\"name\": \"Jason\", \"awesome\": true}), every record stores the evolutionary timeline of all previous revision IDs leading up to itself.\n\nExercise: Take a moment of quiet reflection. Consider any two different records, A and B. If A's revision ID appears in B's timeline, then B definitely evolved from A. Now consider Git's fast-forward merges. Do you hear that? That is the sound of your mind being blown.\n\nGit isn't really a linear list. It has forks, when one parent has multiple children. CouchDB has that too.\n\nExercise: Compare two different records, A and B. A's revision ID does not appear in B's timeline; however, one revision ID, C, is in both A's and B's timeline. Thus A didn't evolve from B. B didn't evolve from A. But rather, A and B have a common ancestor C. In Git, that is a \"fork.\" In CouchDB, it's a \"conflict.\"\nIn Git, if both children go on to develop their timelines independently, that's cool. Forks totally support that.\nIn CouchDB, if both children go on to develop their timelines independently, that cool too. Conflicts totally support that.\nFun fact 3: CouchDB \"conflicts\" do not correspond to Git \"conflicts.\" A Couch conflict is a divergent revision history, what Git calls a \"fork.\" For this reason the CouchDB community pronounces \"conflict\" with a silent n: \"co-flicked.\"\n\nGit also has merges, when one child has multiple parents. CouchDB sort of has that too.\n\nIn the data model, there is no merge. The client simply marks one timeline as deleted and continues to work with the only extant timeline.\nIn the application, it feels like a merge. Typically, the client merges the data from each timeline in an application-specific way. Then it writes the new data to the timeline. In Git, this is like copying and pasting the changes from branch A into branch B, then commiting to branch B and deleting branch A. The data was merged, but there was no git merge.\nThese behaviors are different because, in Git, the timeline itself is important; but in CouchDB, the data is important and the timeline is incidental\u2014it's just there to support replication. That is one reason why CouchDB's built-in revisioning is inappropriate for storing revision data like a wiki page.\n\n\nFinal notes\nAt least one sentence in this writeup (possibly this one) is complete BS."}]}

In say question above, OP is trying to provide instructions on the specific commit his users should clone.\nNote that this question is not about How To Clone To A Particular Version using reset; but about why isn't there?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Two answers so far (at the time I wrote this, now there are more) are correct in what they say, but don't really answer the \"why\" question.  Of course, the \"why\" question is really hard to answer, except by the authors of the various bits of Git (and even then, what if two frequent Git contributors gave two different answers?).\nStill, considering Git's \"philosophy\" as it were, in general, the various transfer protocols work by naming a reference.  If they provide an SHA-1, it's the SHA-1 of that reference.  For someone who does not already have direct (e.g., command-line) access to the repository, none1 of the built in commands allow one to refer to commits by ID.  The closest thing I can find to a reason for this\u2014and it is actually a good reason2\u2014is this bit in the git upload-archive documentation:\n\nSECURITY\nIn order to protect the privacy of objects that have been removed from\n  history but may not yet have been pruned, git-upload-archive avoids\n  serving archives for commits and trees that are not reachable from the\n  repository's refs. However, because calculating object reachability is\n  computationally expensive, git-upload-archive implements a stricter but\n  easier-to-check set of rules ...\n\nHowever, it goes on to say:\n\nIf the config option uploadArchive.allowUnreachable is true, these\n  rules are ignored, and clients may use arbitrary sha1 expressions. This\n  is useful if you do not care about the privacy of unreachable objects,\n  or if your object database is already publicly available for access via\n  non-smart-http.\n\nwhich is particularly interesting since git clone gets all reachable objects in the first place, after which your local clone could trivially check out a commit by SHA-1 ID (and create a local branch name pointing to that ID if desired, or just leave your clone in \"detached HEAD\" mode).\nGiven these two cross-currents, I think the real answer to \"why\", at this point, is \"nobody cares enough to add it\". :-)  The privacy argument is valid, but there is no reason that git clone could not check out a commit by ID after cloning, just as it can be told to check out some branch other than master3 with git clone -b ....  The only drawback to allowing -b sha1 is that Git cannot check up front (before the cloning process begins) whether sha1 will be received.  It can check reference names, since those are transferred (along with their branch tips or other SHA-1 values) up front, so git clone -b nonexistentbranch ssh://... terminates quickly and does not create the copy:\nfatal: Remote branch nonexistentbranch not found in upstream origin\nfatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly\n\nIf -b allowed an ID, you'd get the whole clone, then it would have to tell you: \"oh gosh, sorry, can't check out that ID, I'll leave you on master instead\" or whatever.  (Which is more or less what happens now with a busted submodule.)\n\n1While git upload-archive now enforces this \"privacy\" rule, this was not always the case (it was introduced in version 1.7.8.1); and many (most?) git-web servers, including the one distributed with Git itself, allow viewing by arbitrary ID.  This is probably why allowUnreachable was added to upload-archive a few years after the \"only by ref name\" code was added (but note that releases of Git after 1.7.8 and before 2.0.0 have no way to loosen the rules).  Hence, while the \"security\" idea is valid, there was a period (pre 1.7.8.1) when it was not enforced.\n2There are numerous ways to \"leak\" ostensibly private data out of a Git repository.  A new file, Documentation/transfer-data-leaks, is about to appear in Git 2.11.1, while Git 2.11.0 added some internal features (see commit 722ff7f87 among others) to immediately drop objects pushed but not accepted.  Such objects are eventually garbage-collected, but that leaves them exposed for the duration.\n3Actually, by default git clone makes a local check-out of the branch it thinks goes with the remote's HEAD reference.  Usually that's master anyway, though."}]}

Eg: alongside the microservice source code which has the tooling for building/releasing that particular microservice. \nTemplate the kubernetes configuration with something like jinja and render the templates according to the environment you're targeting.\n\nThe tooling is reasonably straightforward to figure out by putting together a few bash scripts or integrating with a Makefile etc.\nEDIT: to answer some of the questions in the comment\nThe application source code repository is used as the single source of truth. So that means that if everything works as it should, changes should never be moved from the kubernetes cluster to the repository.\nChanges directly on the server are prohibited in our workflow. If it ever does happen, we have to manually make sure they enter the application repository again.\nAgain, just want to note that the configurations stored in the source code are actually templates and use secretKeyRef quite liberally. This means that some configurations are coming in from the CI tooling as they are rendered and some are coming in from secrets that live only on the cluster (like database passwords, API tokens etc.)."}]}

Consider enabling it with:\n  $ git config 'lfs.https://github.com/<my_repo>.git/info/lfs.locksverify' true\nEverything up-to-date\nMikes-Mac$ \n\nWhat is this Locking support? Is this some sort of mutex locking for the LFS (large file storage)? If so, isn't it absolutely essential to get anything on git to work?  (Minimally, how else could the \"ordering\" of the log history be established? Worse case, couldn't I have a binary file corrupted by simultaneous writes?)\nMy Actions\nI didn't do anything differently to this repository recently, nor have I done anything differently with this repository compared to any others that I've established with LFS.\nI'm therefore assuming this is a new comment being provided to \"the world\" to let us know of new features.\nNo Obvious Documentation\nHowever, neither a Google search nor a quick search through their documentation led me to anything to explain this. So, I'm left wondering:\n\nWhat is this locking?\n\n\nIs it mutex? If so, how could my repo even function without it?\nIs this limited to just LFS? How is it different from normal git file locking?\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of adding locking support for LFS?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Locking support of Git LFS is documented here https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/File-Locking.\n\nGit LFS v2.0.0 includes an early release of File Locking. File Locking lets developers lock files they are updating to prevent other users from updating them at the same time. Concurrent edits in Git repositories will lead to merge conflicts, which are very difficult to resolve in large binary files.\n\n\nOnce file patterns in .gitattributes are lockable, Git LFS will make them readonly on the local file system automatically. This prevents users from accidentally editing a file without locking it first.\n\n\nGit LFS will verify that you're not modifying a file locked by another user when pushing. Since File Locking is an early release, and few LFS servers implement the API, Git LFS won't halt your push if it cannot verify locked files. You'll see a message like this:\n$ git lfs push origin master --all\nRemote \"origin\" does not support the LFS locking API. Consider disabling it with:\n  $ git config 'lfs.http://git-server.com/user/test.locksverify' false\nGit LFS: (0 of 0 files, 7 skipped) 0 B / 0 B, 879.11 KB skipped\n \n\n$ git lfs push origin master --all\nLocking support detected on remote \"origin\".

This isn't so much a purely technical question, as in that it's more about which of the available options is most appropriate. \nBasically, I'm leaning towards a system that closely mirrors the common \"git flow\" structure (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), with some exceptions to adapt it to our development environment. In short:\n\nA project will have at least a 'develop' and 'master' branch\n'master' will contain the latest production ready code\n'develop' will contain the latest merged code\nAnything else will be in either a 'feature/ticket{number}' or 'hotfix/ticket{number}' branch\nFeature branches will be made from 'develop', hotfix branches from 'master'\nThe number in the branch name will always correspond with the ticket number in our own change/bug system\nFeatures can be tested individually, but also in combination, by building the appropriate branch or merging it to 'develop' first\n\nSo far, it's really helped us streamline our development and prevent conflicts between projects. The one detail that's spawned some debate here is; should we merge feature/ticket branches back into their respective origins with the '--squash' option? I'm somewhat of a fan of this, and what I like about it:\n\nThe git log for develop remains clean and readable, all commits will simply state the original branch name (which tells us if it was a hotfix or a feature, and the ticket number)\nEven after clearing out the original feature or hotfix branch, the merge can cause no confusion afterwards\n\nMaybe these reasons won't turn out to be good enough, and maybe there's good reasons not to use '--squash' in this scenario. Any thoughts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[S]hould we merge feature/ticket branches back into their respective origins with the --squash option?\n\nIt all depends how fine-grained you want the history of your repo to be. Keep in mind that version control, via commit messages, is a form of code documentation. Squashing willy-nilly is certainly not good practice. It may be fine for a hotfix branch, but rarely is for a substantial feature branch.\nAs an analogy, imagine if you asked me for a lend of my Lost DVD boxset (i.e. you cloned my repo), and I just gave you the box, no DVDs, and told you\n\nHere, just read the summary of the series on the backcover. That should tell you enough about the plot.\n\nSo, by all means, squash your commits when you want to get rid of intermediate steps that are needlessly detailed or not self-contained enough, but not to the point that it obscures the evolution of your repository.\n\n(I discuss this matter further in this Twitter thread.)"}]}

You'll get this:\n- A - B (HEAD, master)      # - C is still here, but there's no\n                            # branch pointing to it anymore\n\nYou'd actually get that effect if you use --mixed or --soft too - the only difference is what happens to your work tree and index.

If you make a new commit D at this point, you'll get this, which is probably not what you want:\n- A - B - C (master)\n       \\\n        D (HEAD)\n\nSo, you use checkout to, well, check out that commit.

How do I undo this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PetSerAl's comment is the key.  Here's the two command sequence to do just what you want:\ngit reset --soft @{1}\ngit commit -C @{1}\n\nand an explanation of how this works.\nDescription\nWhen you make a new commit, Git usually1 uses this sequence of events:\n\nRead the ID (SHA-1 hash, like a123456...) of the current commit (via HEAD, which gives us the current branch).  Let's call this ID C (for Current).  Note that this current commit has a parent commit; let's call its ID P (for Parent).\nTurn the index (aka staging-area) into a tree.  This produces another ID; let's call this ID T (for Tree).\nWrite a new commit with parent = C and tree = T.  This new commit gets another ID.  Let's call this N (for New).\nUpdate the branch with the new commit ID N.\n\nWhen using --amend Git changes the process a bit.  It still writes a new commit as before, but in step 3, instead of writing the new commit with parent = C, it writes it with parent = P.\nPicture\nPictorially, we can draw what happened this way.  We start with a commit graph that ends in P--C, pointed-to by branch:\n...--P--C   <-- branch\n\nWhen we make the new commit N we get:\n...--P--C--N   <-- branch\n\nWhen we use --amend, we get this instead:\n       C\n      /\n...--P--N   <-- branch\n\nNote that commit C is still in the repository; it's just been shoved aside, up out of the way, so that new commit N can point back to old parent P.\nGoal\nWhat you realized you want, after the git commit --amend, is to have the chain look instead like:\n...--P--C--N   <-- branch\n\nWe can't quite do this\u2014we can't change N; Git can never change any commit (or any other object) once it's stored in the repo\u2014but note that the ...--P--C chain is still in there, fully intact.  You can find commit C through the reflogs, and this is what the @{1} syntax does.  (Specifically, this is short for currentbranch@{1},2 which means \"where currentbranch pointed one step ago\", which was \"to commit C\".)\nSo, we now run git reset --soft @{1}, which does this:\n       C   <-- branch\n      /\n...--P--N\n\nNow branch points to C, which points back to P.\nWhat happens to N?  The same thing that happened to C before: it's saved for a while through the reflog.\nWe don't really need it (although it may come in handy), because the --soft flag to git reset keeps the index / staging-area untouched (along with the work-tree).  This means we can make a new commit again now, by just running another git commit.  It will go through the same four steps (read the ID from HEAD, create the tree, create a new commit, and update the branch):\n       C--N2   <-- branch\n      /\n...--P--N\n\nwhere N2 will be our new new (second new?) commit.\nWe can even make git commit re-use the commit message from commit N.  The git commit command has a --reuse-message argument, also spelled -C; all we have to do is give it something that lets it find the original new commit N from which to copy the message, to make N2 with.  How do we do that?  The answer is: it's in the reflog, just as C was when we needed to do the git reset.\nIn fact, it's the same @{1}!\nRemember, @{1} means \"where it was just a moment ago\", and git reset just updated it, moving it from C to N.  We haven't yet made new commit N2.  (Once we do that, N will be @{2}, but we haven't yet.)\nSo, putting it all together, we get:\ngit reset --soft @{1}\ngit commit -C @{1}\n\n\n1The places this description breaks down include when you're amending a merge, when you're on a detached HEAD, and when you use an alternative index.  Even then, though, it's pretty obvious how to modify the description.\n2If HEAD is detached, so that there is no current branch, the meaning becomes HEAD@{1}.  Note that @ by itself is short for HEAD, so the fact that @{n} refers to the current branch, rather than to HEAD itself, is a bit inconsistent.\nTo see how they differ, consider git checkout develop followed by git checkout master (assuming both branches exist).  The first checkout changes HEAD to point to develop, and the second changes HEAD to point to master.  This means that master@{1} is whatever commit master pointed to, before the last update to master; but HEAD@{1} is the commit develop points to now\u2014probably some other commit.\n(Recap: after these two git checkout commands, @{1} means master@{1} now, HEAD@{1} means the same commit as develop now, and @ means HEAD.  If you're confused, well, so was I, and apparently I am not alone: see the comments.)"}]}

I thought git merge --squash feature1 merged feature1 into mainline."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This happens because Git doesn't know that the squash merge is \"equivalent to\" the various branch-specific commits.  You must forcibly delete the branch, with git branch -D instead of git branch -d.\n(The rest of this is merely about why this is the case.)\nDraw the commit graph\nLet's draw (part of) the commit graph (this step is appropriate for so many things in Git...).  In fact, let's step back one more step, so that we start before your git rebase, with something like this:\n...--o--o--o     <-- mainline\n      \\\n       A--B--C   <-- feature1\n\nA branch name, like mainline or feature1, points only to one specific commit.  That commit points back (leftward) to a previous commit, and so on, and it's these backward pointers that form the actual branches.\nThe top row of commits, all just called o here, are kind of boring, so we didn't give them letter-names.  The bottom row of commits, A-B-C, are only on branch feature1.  C is the newest such commit; it leads back to B, which leads back to A, which leads back to one of the boring o commits.  (As an aside: the leftmost o commit, along with all earlier commits in the ... section, is on both branches.)\nWhen you ran git rebase, the three A-B-C commits were copied to new commits appended to the tip of mainline, giving us:\n...--o--o--o            <-- mainline\n      \\     \\\n       \\     A'-B'-C'   <-- feature1\n        \\\n         A--B--C       [old feature1, now abandoned]\n\nThe new A'-B'-C' commits are mostly the same as the original three, but they are moved in the graph.  (Note that all three boring o commits are on both branches now.)  Abandoning the original three means that Git usually doesn't have to compare the copies to the originals.  (If the originals had been reachable by some other name\u2014a branch that appended to the old feature1, for instance\u2014Git can figure this out, at least in most cases.  The precise details of how Git figures this out are not particularly important here.)\nAnyway, now you go on to run git checkout mainline; git merge --squash feature1.  This makes one new commit that is a \"squash copy\" of the three\u2014or however many\u2014commits that are on feature1.  I will stop drawing the old abandoned ones, and call the new squash-commit S for Squash:\n...--o--o--o--S         <-- mainline\n            \\\n             A'-B'-C'   <-- feature1\n\n\"Delete safety\" is determined entirely by commit history\nWhen you ask Git to delete feature1, it performs a safety check: \"is feature1 merged into mainline?\"  This \"is merged into\" test is based purely on the graph connectivity.  The name mainline points to commit S; commit S points back to the first boring o commit, which leads back to more boring o commits.  Commit C', the tip of feature1, is not reachable from S: we're not allowed to move rightward, only leftward.\nContrast this with making a \"normal\" merge M:\n...--o--o--o---------M   <-- mainline\n            \\       /\n             A'-B'-C'    <-- feature1\n\nUsing the same test\u2014\"is the tip commit of feature1 reachable from the tip commit of mainline?\"\u2014the answer is now yes, because commit M has a down-and-left link to commit C'.  (Commit C' is, in Git internal parlance, the second parent of merge commit M.)\nSince squash merges are not actually merges, though, there is no connection from S back to C'.\nAgain, Git doesn't even try to see if S is \"the same as\" A', B', or C'.  If it did, though, it would say \"not the same\", because S is only the same as the sum of all three commits.  The only way to get S to match the squashed commits is to have only one such commit (and in this case, there's no need to squash in the first place)."}]}

Here's a step by step instruction:\n\nCreate two remote repositories(on GitHub or BitBucket or wherever else) with different names, for example: one myrepo and the other privates.myrepo. Make the myrepo a public repository and the privates.myrepo a private repository.\nOn local, initiate a single git repository: git init.\nAdd the non-private files now in the repository and make an initial commit.\nConnect this repository to the public remote:\n\ngit remote add <remote_branch_name> <remote_repository_address>\n\nin our example which becomes:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/myrepo.git\n\n\nPush: git push -u origin master\n\nNow add a branch to the local repository and switch to it: git checkout -b private_work\n\nHere comes the important step: Connect this branch to the other remote, i.e, the private one. In our example:\n\n\ngit remote add privates https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/privates.myrepo.git\n\n\nNext, add the private files to the local repository and make a commit.\nPush the private_work branch to the privates remote: git push -u privates private_work\n\n\nRead more explanation on how it works here: https://24ways.org/2013/keeping-parts-of-your-codebase-private-on-github/. I've also learned this from him.\nSee a cool terminal-show recording of all these steps together here: http://showterm.io/04130676d3401229e7df6\nAlso, you can add an alias like alias private_push='git push privates private_work in an startup script like .bashrc in case you're on Linux, in order to lower the chances of making a wrong push of private work to the public repository."}]}

Here are a few things you can do.\nFind branches the commit is on\ngit branch -a --contains <commit>\n\nThis will tell you all branches which have the given commit in their history. Obviously this is less useful if the commit's already been merged.\nSearch the reflogs\nIf you are working in the repository in which the commit was made, you can search the reflogs for the line for that commit. Reflogs older than 90 days are pruned by git-gc, so if the commit's too old, you won't find it. That said, you can do this:\ngit reflog show --all | grep a871742\n\nto find commit a871742. Note that you MUST use the abbreviatd 7 first digits of the commit.  The output should be something like this:\na871742 refs/heads/completion@{0}: commit (amend): mpc-completion: total rewrite\n\nindicating that the commit was made on the branch \"completion\". The default output shows abbreviated commit hashes, so be sure not to search for the full hash or you won't find anything.\ngit reflog show is actually just an alias for git log -g --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline, so if you want to fiddle with the output format to make different things available to grep for, that's your starting point!\nIf you're not working in the repository where the commit was made, the best you can do in this case is examine the reflogs and find when the commit was first introduced to your repository; with any luck, you fetched the branch it was committed to. This is a bit more complex, because you can't walk both the commit tree and reflogs simultaneously. You'd want to parse the reflog output, examining each hash to see if it contains the desired commit or not.\nFind a subsequent merge commit\nThis is workflow-dependent, but with good workflows, commits are made on development branches which are then merged in. You could do this:\ngit log --merges <commit>..\n\nto see merge commits that have the given commit as an ancestor. (If the commit was only merged once, the first one should be the merge you're after; otherwise you'll have to examine a few, I suppose.) The merge commit message should contain the branch name that was merged.\nIf you want to be able to count on doing this, you may want to use the --no-ff option to git merge to force merge commit creation even in the fast-forward case. (Don't get too eager, though. That could become obfuscating if overused.) VonC's answer to a related question helpfully elaborates on this topic."}]}

Or if you're committing someone else's patch they emailed to you and want to attribute the author.)\nChange any of that and the commit ID changes.  And yes, the same commit with the same properties will have the same ID on a different machine.  This serves three purposes.  First, it means the system can tell if a commit has been tampered with.  It's baked right into the architecture.\nSecond, one can rapidly compare commits just by looking at their IDs.  This makes Git's network protocols very efficient.  Want to compare two commits to see if they're the same?  Don't have to send the whole diff, just send the IDs.\nThird, and this is the genius, two commits with the same IDs have the same history.  That's why the ID of the previous commits are part of the hash.  If the content of a commit is the same but the parents are different, the commit ID must be different.  That means when comparing repositories (like in a push or pull) once Git finds a commit in common between the two repositories it can stop checking.  This makes pushing and pulling extremely efficient.  For example...\norigin\nA - B - C - D - E [master]\n\nA - B [origin/master]\n\nThe network conversation for git fetch origin goes something like this...\n\nlocal Hey origin, what branches do you have?\norigin I have master at E.\nlocal I don't have E, I have your master at B.\norigin B you say?  I have B and it's an ancestor of E.  That checks out.  Let me send you C, D and E.\n\nThis is also why when you rewrite a commit with rebase, everything after it has to change.  Here's an example.\nA - B - C - D - E - F - G [master]\n\nLet's say you rewrite D, just to change the log message a bit.  Now D can no longer be D, it has to be copied to a new commit we'll call D1.\nA - B - C - D - E - F - G [master]\n         \\\n          D1\n\nWhile D1 can have C as its parent (C is unaffected, commits do not know their children) it is disconnected from E, F and G.  If we change E's parent to D1, E can't be E anymore.  It has to be copied to a new commit E1.\nA - B - C - D - E - F - G [master]\n         \\\n          D1 - E1\n\nAnd so on with F to F1 and G to G1.\nA - B - C - D - E - F - G\n         \\\n          D1 - E1 - F1 - G1 [master]\n\nThey all have the same code, just different parents (or in D1's case, a different commit message)."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Creating a GitHub repository with only a subset of a local repository's history\nThe background: I'm moving closer to open sourcing a personal research code I've been working on for more than two years. It started life as an SVN repository, but I moved to Git about a year ago, and I'd like to share the code on GitHub. However, it accumulated a lot of cruft over the years, and I'd prefer that the public version begin its life at its current status. However, I'd still like to contribute to it and incorporate other people's potential contributions.\nThe question: is there a way to \"fork\" a Git repository such that no history is retained on the fork (which lives on GitHub), but that my local repository still has a complete history, and I can pull/push to GitHub?\nI don't have any experience in the administrating end of large repositories, so detail is very much appreciated."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can create a new, fresh history quite easily in Git. Let\u2019s say you want your master branch to be the one that you will push to GitHub, and your full history to be stored in old-master. You can just move your master branch to old-master, and then start a fresh new branch with no history using git checkout --orphan:\ngit branch -m master old-master\ngit checkout --orphan master\ngit commit -m \"Import clean version of my code\"\n\nNow you have a new master branch with no history, which you can push to GitHub. But, as you say, you would like to be able to see all of the old history in your local repository; and would probably like for it to not be disconnected.\nYou can do this using git replace. A replacement ref is a way of specifying an alternate commit any time Git looks at a given commit. So you can tell Git to look at the last commit of your old branch, instead of the first commit of your new branch, when looking at history. In order to do this, you need to bring in the disconnected history from the old repository.\ngit replace master old-master\n\nNow you have your new branch, in which you can see all of your history, but the actual commit objects are disconnected from the old history, and so you can push the new commits to GitHub without the old commits coming along. Push your master branch to GitHub, and only the new commits will go to GitHub. But take a look at the history in gitk or git log, and you'll see the full history.\ngit push github master:master\ngitk --all\n\nGotchas\nIf you ever base any new branches on the old commits, you will have to be careful to keep the history separate; otherwise, new commits on those branches will really have the old commits in their history, and so you'll pull the whole history along if you push it up to GitHub. As long as you keep all of your new commits based on your new master, though, you'll be fine.\nIf you ever run git push --tags github, that will push all of your tags, including old ones, which will cause all of your old history to be pulled along with it. You could deal with this by deleting all of your old tags (git tag -d $(git tag -l)), or by never using git push --tags but only ever pushing tags manually, or by using two repositories as described below.\nThe basic problem underlying both of these gotchas is that if you ever push any ref which connects to any of the old history (other than via the replaced commits), you will push up all of the old history. Probably the best way of avoiding this is by using two repositories, one which contains only the new commits, and one which contains both the old and new history, for the purpose of inspecting the full history. You do all of your work, your committing, your pushing and pulling from GitHub, in the repository with just the new commits; that way, you can't possibly accidentally push your old commits up.\nYou then pull all of your new commits into your repository that has the full history, whenever you need to look at the entire thing. You can either pull from GitHub or your other local repository, whichever is more convenient. It will be your archive, but to avoid accidentally publishing your old history, you don't ever push to GitHub from it. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n~$ mkdir newrepo\n~$ cd newrepo\nnewrepo$ git init\nnewrepo$ git pull ~/oldrepo master\n# Now newrepo has just the new history; we can set up oldrepo to pull from it\nnewrepo$ cd ~/oldrepo\noldrepo$ git remote add newrepo ~/newrepo\noldrepo$ git remote update\noldrepo$ git branch --set-upstream master newrepo/master\n# ... do work in newrepo, commit, push to GitHub, etc.\n# Now if we want to look at the full history in oldrepo:\noldrepo$ git pull\n\nIf you're on Git older than 1.7.2\nYou don't have git checkout --orphan, so you'll have to do it manually by creating a fresh repository from the current revision of your existing repository, and then pulling in your old disconnected history. You can do this with, for example:\n\noldrepo$ mkdir ~/newrepo\noldrepo$ cp $(git ls-files) ~/newrepo\noldrepo$ cd ~/newrepo\nnewrepo$ git init\nnewrepo$ git add .\nnewrepo$ git commit -m \"Import clean version of my code\"\nnewrepo$ git fetch ~/oldrepo master:old-master\n\nIf you're on Git older than 1.6.5\ngit replace and replace refs were added in 1.6.5, so you'll have to use an older, somewhat less flexible mechanism known as grafts, which allow you to specify alternate parents for a given commit. Instead of the git replace command, run:\necho $(git rev-parse master) $(git rev-parse old-master) >> .git/info/grafts\n\nThis will make it look, locally, as if the master commit has the old-master commit as its parent, so you will see one more commit than you would with git replace."}]}

Well, in this case it is because the techstacks tools site does not support SSLv2, thus, generating the curl (35) error.\n\nThe Destination Site Does Not Like the Cipher\n\nYou could be trying to connect to the site using an ssl cipher that the site is configured to reject.\n  For example, anonymous ciphers are typically disabled on ssl-encrypted sites that are customer-facing. (Many of us set a blanket rejection policy on any SSL-encrypted web site\u2014regardless of it's purpose.)\n  The following command string \"can\" also result in the curl (35) error:\n\ncurl --ciphers ADH-RC4-MD5 https://some_web_site.some_domain.com/\n\n\nUnfortunately, the type of error response you can get from curl depends largely upon the ssl server. On some sites, you'll receive the Unknown SSL Protocol error but on my techstacks-tools site, I get:\n\ncurl: (35) error:14077410:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure\n\n\nKudos to Google because this particular error is a bit more descriptive than the one my websites at work generate because this at least tells you that a ssl socket was started but because of handshake failures, the socket was never able to complete.\nTry connecting to the site with a cipher that the site supports. Not sure which cipher to use?   Well, let me introduce my cryptonark ssl cipher tester...\n\nThe SSL Private Key Has Expired\n\nI came across this one earlier today working with an old WebSeAL site.\n  In IBM GSKit, you can specify how long the private key password is valid. After reaching a certain date, you will still be able to get webseal started and listening on port 443 (or whatever you set your https-port value to) but you will not be able to successfully negotiate an SSL session.\n  In today's case, the old WebSEAL instance was using long-expired kdb file with a long expired private key password. Once replaced with the correct, more-up-to-date version, everything worked again.\n\nImproper redirection\n\nSome ISP's and DNS providers like to intercept your failed DNS queries in order to redirect you to a search engine results-style page offering you alternative URLs or \"Did you mean...?\" counter-query results.\n  If you see an error like this: \n\n error:140770FC:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocol, \n\n\nit could be due to you typing the hostname incorrectly or the hostname is not yet tabled in your DNS. You can verify that with a simple \"host\" or \"nslookup\".\n\n\nNote (August 2015): Git 2.6+ (Q3 2015) will allow to specify the SSL version explicitly:\n\nhttp: add support for specifying the SSL version\n\nSee commit 01861cb (14 Aug 2015) by Elia Pinto (devzero2000).\nHelped-by: Eric Sunshine (sunshineco).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit ed070a4, 26 Aug 2015) \nhttp.sslVersion\n\n\nThe SSL version to use when negotiating an SSL connection, if you want to force the default.\n  The available and default version depend on whether libcurl was built against NSS or OpenSSL and the particular configuration of the crypto library in use. Internally this sets the 'CURLOPT_SSL_VERSION' option; see the libcurl documentation for more details on the format of this option and for the ssl version supported.\n  Actually the possible values of this option are:\n\nsslv2\nsslv3\ntlsv1\ntlsv1.0\ntlsv1.1\ntlsv1.2\n\nCan be overridden by the 'GIT_SSL_VERSION' environment variable.\n  To force git to use libcurl's default ssl version and ignore any explicit http.sslversion option, set 'GIT_SSL_VERSION' to the empty string."}]}

But if I am using gitlab on my server and there is no limit of file size in a repo, and I don't care the repo size to be super large on my server. In this condition, what's the advantage of git lfs?git clone or git checkout will be faster?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One specificity of Git (and other distributed systems) compared to centralized systems is that each repository contains the whole history of the project. Suppose you create a 100 MB file, modify it 100 times in a way that doesn't compress well. You'll end up with a 10 GB repository. This means that each clone will download 10 GB of data, eat 10 GB of disk space on each machine on which you're making a clone. What's even more frustrating: you'd still have to download these 10 GB of data even if you git rm the big files.\nPutting big files in a separate system like git-lfs allow you to store only pointers to each version of the file in the repository, hence each clone will only download a tiny piece of data for each revision. The checkout will download only the version you are using, i.e. 100 MB in the example above. As a result, you would be using disk space on the server, but saving a lot of bandwidth and disk space on the client.\nIn addition to this, the algorithm used by git gc (internally, git repack) does not always work well with big files. Recent versions of Git made progress in this area and it should work reasonably well, but using a big repository with big files in it may eventually get you in trouble (like not having enough RAM to repack your repository)."}]}

So merging would be much easier if they can be somehow marked and every merge would result in conflict requiring manual merge.\nI searched for an answer :\n\nI am using --no-commit and --no-ff merge options, but it is not the same.\nHere and here someone asks the same question but with no solution.\nSimilar case seems to be how to prevent file being merged using .gitattributes containing: somefile.php merge=ours . I tried to find some merge option which would generate conflict or force manual merge but found none so far.\n.gitattributes containing: somefile.php -merge is never merged automatically and therefore forcing manual merge. It is 90% solution, but what I seek is to try automatic merge and mark it as conflict regardless it is successful or not. But this is so far closest to solution. (...thanks Charles Bailey for clarification...)\nSomeone suggest to write custom merge driver (1, 2), but how to do it is far from clear to me. \n\nedit: variant 4. description"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Option 5, a custom merge driver, is probably the way to get closest to what you want. It is surprisingly easy to do. Below is an example of one that I think should get you pretty close to the behavior you desire.\nFirst, create a merge driver script called merge-and-verify-driver. Make it executable and put it in a suitable location (you may want to consider checking this script into the repo, even, since the repo's config file is going to depend on it). Git is going to execute this shell script to perform the merge of the sensitive files:\n#!/bin/bash\ngit merge-file \"${1}\" \"${2}\" \"${3}\"\nexit 1\n\nThis just does the default merge behavior that Git itself normally does. The key difference is that the script always returns non-zero (to indicate that there was a conflict, even if the merge was actually resolved without conflicts).\nNext, you need to tell Git about the existence of your custom merge driver. You do this in the repo's config file (.git/config):\n[merge \"verify\"]\n        name = merge and verify driver\n        driver = ./merge-and-verify-driver %A %O %B\n\nIn this example, I've put merge-and-verify-driver in the repo's top level directory (./). You will need to specify the path to the script accordingly.\nNow, you just need to give the sensitive files the proper attributes so that the custom merge driver is used when merging those files. Add this to your .gitattributes file:\n*.sensitive merge=verify\n\nHere, I've told Git that any file with a name matching the pattern *.sensitive should use the custom merge driver. Obviously, you need to use pattern that is appropriate for your file(s)."}]}

If others have based work off of the commits that you\u2019re going to delete, plenty of conflicts can occur.

Once this is done and saved, another editor pops up with the following:\n# This is a combination of 4 commits.\n# The first commit's message is:\nAdding license\n\n# This is the 2nd commit message:\n\nMoving license into its own file\n\n# This is the 3rd commit message:\n\nJekyll has become self-aware.\n\n# This is the 4th commit message:\n\nChanged the tagline in the binary, too.\n\n# Please enter the commit message for your changes.

Edit the message as you see fit, then save and quit.\nOnce that\u2019s done, your commits have been successfully squashed!\nCreated commit 0fc4eea: Creating license file, and making jekyll self-aware.\n 4 files changed, 27 insertions(+), 30 deletions(-)\n  create mode 100644 LICENSE\n  Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/master.\n\nAnd if we look at the history again\u2026\n\n\n\nNote: for \"commit squashing\" purposes, Git1.7 (February 2010) has introduced 2 new elements (as mentioned by Dustin in the comment):\n\n\n\"git rebase -i\" learned new action \"fixup\" that squashes the change but does not affect existing log message.\n\"git rebase -i\" also learned --autosquash option that is useful together with the new \"fixup\" action.\n\n\nBoth (fixup action and --autosquash option) are illustrated in this Thechnosorcery Networks blog entry. Those features have been cooking since last June 2009 and debated further last December.\nThe fixup action or directive is for squashing a commit you would have manually reordered in the commit edit list of a rebase --interactive, while ignoring the second commit message, which will make the message edition step faster (you can just save it: the squashed commit will have the first commit message only)\nThe resulting commit message will only be the first commit one.\n  # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit\n  # f, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message\n\nThe --autosquash option is about making the commit reordering process automatically for you:\n\nIf you know what commit you want to squash something in to you can commit it with a message of \u201csquash! $other_commit_subject\u201d. Then if you run @git rebase --interactive --autosquash commitish@, the line will automatically be set as squash, and placed below the commit with the subject of $other_commit_subject.\n\n(Actually, the squash! can only use the beginning of another commit message)\n$ vim Foo.txt\n$ git commit -am \"Change all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\"\n[topic 8374d8e] Change all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\n 1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)\n$ vim Bar.txt\n$ git commit -am \"Change all the 'Foo's to 'Bar's\"\n[topic 2d12ce8] Change all the 'Foo's to 'Bar's\n 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)\n\n$ vim Foo.txt\n$ git commit -am \"squash! Change all the 'Bar's\"\n[topic 259a7e6] squash! Change all the 'Bar's\n 1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)\n\nSee? Here the third commit uses only the beginning of the first commit message.\nA rebase --interactive --autosquash will move the squashed commit below the relevant one:\npick 8374d8e Change all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\nsquash 259a7e6 squash! Change all the 'Bar's\npick 2d12ce8 Change all the 'Foo's to 'Bar's\n\nThe message edition would be:\n# This is a combination of 2 commits.\n# The first commit's message is:\n\nChange all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\n\n# This is the 2nd commit message:\n\nsquash! Change all the 'Bar's\n\nMeaning by default you would keep the squashing operation recorded in the commit message.\nBut with the fixup! directive, you could keep that squashing \"invisible\" in the commit message, while still benefiting from the automatic commit reordering with the --autosquash option (and the fact that your second commit message is based on the first commit you want to be squashed with).\npick 8374d8e Change all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\nfixup cfc6e54 fixup! Change all the 'Bar's\npick 2d12ce8 Change all the 'Foo's to 'Bar's\n\nThe message by default will be:\n# This is a combination of 2 commits.\n# The first commit's message is:\n\nChange all the 'Bar's to 'Foo's\n\n# The 2nd commit message will be skipped:\n\n#    fixup! Change all the 'Bar's\n\n\nNotice that the fixup! commit\u2019s message is already commented out.\nYou can just save out the message as-is, and your original commit message will be kept.\nVery handy for including changes when you realize that you forgot to add part of an earlier commit.\n\nNow if you want to fixup or squash based on the previous commit you just did, Jacob Helwig (the author of the Technosorcery Networks blog entry) recommends the following aliases:\n[alias]\n    fixup = !sh -c 'git commit -m \\\"fixup! $(git log -1 --format='\\\\''%s'\\\\'' $@)\\\"' -\n    squash = !sh -c 'git commit -m \\\"squash! $(git log -1 --format='\\\\''%s'\\\\'' $@)\\\"' -\n\nAnd for doing a rebase interactive which will always benefit from the automatic reordering of commits meant to be squashed:\n[alias]\n    ri = rebase --interactive --autosquash\n\n\nUpdate for Git 2.18 (Q2 2018): \"git rebase -i\" sometimes left intermediate \"# This is a combination of N commits\" message meant for the human consumption\ninside an editor in the final result in certain corner cases, which\nhas been fixed.\nSee commit 15ef693, commit dc4b5bc, commit e12a7ef, commit d5bc6f2 (27 Apr 2018) by Johannes Schindelin (dscho).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 4a3bf32, 23 May 2018)\n\nrebase --skip: clean up commit message after a failed fixup/squash\n\n\nDuring a series of fixup/squash commands, the interactive rebase builds\nup a commit message with comments. This will be presented to the user in\nthe editor if at least one of those commands was a squash.\nIn any case, the commit message will be cleaned up eventually, removing\nall those intermediate comments, in the final step of such a fixup/squash chain.\nHowever, if the last fixup/squash command in such a chain fails with\nmerge conflicts, and if the user then decides to skip it (or resolve it\nto a clean worktree and then continue the rebase), the current code\nfails to clean up the commit message.\nThis commit fixes that behavior.\nThe fix is quite a bit more involved than meets the eye because it is\nnot only about the question whether we are git rebase --skiping a\nfixup or squash. It is also about removing the skipped fixup/squash's\ncommit message from the accumulated commit message. And it is also about\nthe question whether we should let the user edit the final commit\nmessage or not (\"Was there a squash in the chain that was not\nskipped?\").\nFor example, in this case we will want to fix the commit message, but\nnot open it in an editor:\npick  <- succeeds\nfixup <- succeeds\nsquash    <- fails, will be skipped\n\nThis is where the newly-introduced current-fixups file comes in real\nhandy. A quick look and we can determine whether there was a non-skipped\nsquash. We only need to make sure to keep it up to date with respect to\nskipped fixup/squash commands. As a bonus, we can even avoid committing\nunnecessarily, e.g. when there was only one fixup, and it failed, and\nwas skipped.\nTo fix only the bug where the final commit message was not cleaned up\nproperly, but without fixing the rest, would have been more complicated\nthan fixing it all in one go, hence this commit lumps together more than\na single concern.\n\n\nGit 2.19 (Q3 2018) fixes a bug: When \"git rebase -i\" is told to squash two or more commits into one, it labeled the log message for each commit with its number.\nIt correctly called the first one \"1st commit\", but the next one was \"commit #1\", which was off-by-one(!).\nSee commit dd2e36e (15 Aug 2018) by Phillip Wood (phillipwood).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 36fd1e8, 20 Aug 2018)\n\nrebase -i: fix numbering in squash message\n\n\nCommit e12a7ef (\"rebase -i: Handle \"combination of <n> commits\" with\nGETTEXT_POISON\", 2018-04-27, Git 2.18) changed the way that individual commit\nmessages are labelled when squashing commits together.\nIn doing so a regression was introduced where the numbering of the messages is off by one. This commit fixes that and adds a test for the numbering.\n\n\nNote: \"git rebase -i\"(man) with a series of squash/fixup, when one of the steps stopped in conflicts and ended up getting skipped, did not handle the accumulated commit log messages, which has been corrected with Git 2.42 (Q3 2023).\nSee commit 6ce7afe (03 Aug 2023) by Phillip Wood (phillipwood).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit e8c53ff, 09 Aug 2023)\n\nrebase --skip: fix commit message clean up when skipping squash\nSigned-off-by: Phillip Wood\n\n\nDuring a series of \"fixup\" and/or \"squash\" commands, the interactive rebase accumulates a commit message from all the commits that are being squashed together.\nIf one of the commits has conflicts when it is picked and the user chooses to skip that commit then we need to remove that commit's message from accumulated messages.\nTo do this 15ef693 (\"rebase --skip: clean up commit message after a failed fixup/squash\", 2018-04-27, Git v2.18.0-rc0 -- merge listed in batch #6) updated commit_staged_changes() to reset the accumulated message to the commit message of HEAD (which does not contain the message from the skipped commit) when the last command was \"fixup\" or \"squash\" and there are no staged changes.\nUnfortunately the code to do this contains two bugs.\n\nIf parse_head() fails we pass an invalid pointer to\nunuse_commit_buffer().\n\nThe reconstructed message uses the entire commit buffer from HEAD\nincluding the headers, rather than just the commit message.\n\n\nThe first issue is fixed by splitting up the \"if\" condition into several statements each with its own error handling.\nThe second issue is fixed by finding the start of the commit message within the commit buffer using find_commit_subject().\nThe existing test added by 15ef693 is modified to show the effect of this bug.\nThe bug is triggered when skipping the first command in the chain (as the test does before this commit) but the effect is hidden because opts->current_fixup_count is set to zero which leads update_squash_messages() to recreate the squash message file from scratch overwriting the bad message created by commit_staged_changes().\nThe test is also updated to explicitly check the commit messages rather than relying on grep to ensure they do not contain any stray commit headers."}]}

It points directly to a specific commit in the history and will not change unless explicitly updated.\n\n\n\nYou will not be able to checkout the tags if it's not locally in your repository so first, you have to fetch the tags to your local repository.\nFirst, make sure that the tag exists locally by doing\n# --all will fetch all the remotes.\n# --tags will fetch all tags as well\n$ git fetch --all --tags --prune\n\nThen check out the tag by running\n$ git checkout tags/<tag_name> -b <branch_name>\n\nInstead of origin use the tags/ prefix.\n\nIn this sample you have 2 tags version 1.0 & version 1.1 you can check them out with any of the following:\n$ git checkout A  ...\n$ git checkout version 1.0  ...\n$ git checkout tags/version 1.0  ...\n\nAll of the above will do the same since the tag is only a pointer to a given commit.\n\norigin: https://backlog.com/git-tutorial/img/post/stepup/capture_stepup4_1_1.png\n\nHow to see the list of all tags?\n# list all tags\n$ git tag\n\n# list all tags with given pattern ex: v-\n$ git tag --list 'v-*'\n\n\nHow to create tags?\nThere are 2 ways to create a tag:\n# lightweight tag \n$ git tag v1.0\n\n# annotated tag\n$ git tag -a v1.0\n\nThe difference between the 2 is that when creating an annotated tag you can add metadata as you have in a git commit:\nname, e-mail, date, comment & signature\n\nHow to delete tags?\nDelete a local tag\n$ git tag -d <tag_name>\nDeleted tag <tag_name> (was 000000)\n\nNote: If you try to delete a non existig Git tag, there will be see the following error:\n$ git tag -d <tag_name>\nerror: tag '<tag_name>' not found.\n\nDelete remote tags\n# Delete a tag from the server with push tags\n$ git push --delete origin <tag name>\n\nHow to clone a specific tag?\nIn order to grab the content of a given tag, you can use the checkout command.

The .. and ... notations in git diff have the following meanings:\n# Left side in the illustration below:\ngit diff foo..bar\ngit diff foo bar  # same thing as above\n\n# Right side in the illustration below:\ngit diff foo...bar\ngit diff $(git merge-base foo bar) bar  # same thing as above\n\n\nIn other words, git diff foo..bar is exactly the same as git diff foo bar; both will show you the difference between the tips of the two branches foo and bar.  On the other hand, git diff foo...bar will show you the difference between the \"merge base\" of the two branches and the tip of bar.  The \"merge base\" is usually the last commit in common between those two branches, so this command will show you the changes that your work on bar has introduced, while ignoring everything that has been done on foo in the mean time.\nThat's all you need to know about the .. and ... notations in git diff.  However...\n\n... a common source of confusion here is that .. and ... mean subtly different things when used in a command such as git log that expects a set of commits as one or more arguments.  (These commands all end up using git rev-list to parse a list of commits from their arguments.)\nThe meaning of .. and ... for git log can be shown graphically as below:\n\nSo, git rev-list foo..bar shows you everything on branch bar that isn't also on branch foo.  On the other hand, git rev-list foo...bar shows you all the commits that are in either foo or bar, but not both.  The third diagram just shows that if you list the two branches, you get the commits that are in either one or both of them.\nWell, I find that all a bit confusing, anyway, and I think the commit graph diagrams help :)\n\u00b9 I only say \"typically\" since when resolving merge conflicts, for example, git diff will show you a three-way merge."}]}

Here's a small example to show the two results from using these two methods. I also recommend reading the question and answers of (Git Merging) When to use 'ours' strategy, 'ours' option and 'theirs' option?\nFirst, setup a repository with 2 branches and 3 commits (1 base commit, and 1 commit per branch).

Compare that to using the merge strategy (re-init your repository or reset branch, before executing the next steps):\n$ git merge -s ours A\n$ cat file*\noriginal\nB\noriginal\n\nThe result is quite different (branch \"merge-strategy\" in the sample repo). With the strategy option, we get a merge result of both branches, with the strategy we throw away any changes which happened in the other branch.\nYou will also notice that the commit created by the merge-strategy in fact points to the exact same tree as the latest commit of \"our\" branch, while the strategy-option created a new, previously-unseen tree:\n$ git rev-parse A^{tree} B^{tree} merge-strategy^{tree} strategy-option^{tree}\n3859ea064e85b2291d189e798bfa1bff87f51f3e\n0389f8f2a3e560b639d82597a7bc5489a4c96d44\n0389f8f2a3e560b639d82597a7bc5489a4c96d44\n5b09d34a37a183723b409d25268c8cb4d073206e\n\nOP indeed asked for \"I no longer need the old changes in [\u2026] branch\" and \"So I just want to dump all the contents of [A] into [B]\", which is not possible to do with a strategy option. Using the 'ours' merge strategy is one possibility of many, but likely the easiest (other possibilities include using low level commands of Git such as write-tree and commit-tree)."}]}

If there are enough loose objects (by default, at least 6700), it will then invoke git repack -d -l to pack them. If there are too many separate packs, it will also repack them into one.\nA pack is a delta-compressed single file, containing a large number of objects. It's more efficient to store objects in packs, but it takes time to pack (compress) objects, so Git initially creates loose objects, then packs them in batches now and then, via automatic invocation of git gc --auto.\nIf you let Git finish repacking, this won't happen again for a while. It can indeed take a while, especially if you have a lot of large binary objects, but if it's triggering, then it's a sign that it will probably drastically reduce the amount of disk space taken by the repo. If you really don't want it to happen, you can change the config parameter gc.auto. If you increase it to something much larger than 6700, it will happen less frequently, but take longer when it does. If you decrease it, it'll still have to do your current repack, but subsequently it will happen more often and finish more quickly. If you set it to 0, it will disable automatic repacking.\nSee man git-gc (under --auto) and man git-config (under gc.auto) for more information."}]}

But, they say on the page about reducing repo size (section Remove the repository limitation) that they run git gc themselves in response to doing git reset --hard HEAD~1 (which discards last commit) followed by git push -f. Also, they say in the section Garbage collecting dead data that one can try the sequence:\u00a0git reflog expire --expire=now --all,\u00a0git gc --prune=now,\u00a0git push --all --force. Given all this, I decided to try the following locally, hoping it'd cut out the reflog and do a prune locally, and then push them to remote Bitbucket repository, on which it'd start a gc:\ngit reflog expire --expire-unreachable=\"30m\" --all\ngit prune --expire=\"30m\" -v\ngit gc --prune=\"30m\"\ngit reset --hard HEAD~1\ngit push -f\n\nThis worked, repo size immediately went from 2.1GB to ca. 250MB. :)\nNote that the time param to expire / expire-unreachable / prune sets the expiration cut-off point measuring from now back.

If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.\nI did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a / in the name, i.e., topic/task, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.\nWhat are some best practices for naming git branches?\nEdit:\nNobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.\nI do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)\nAs an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the group's CVS repository.  At that point, due to my imperfect interaction with CVS, I would perform that commit and then kill that branch.  (I've seen too much weirdness interacting with CVS if I try to continue to use the same branch at that point.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are some branch naming conventions that I use and the reasons for them\nBranch naming conventions\n\nUse grouping tokens (words) at the beginning of your branch names.\nDefine and use short lead tokens to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.\nUse slashes to separate parts of your branch names.\nDo not use bare numbers as leading parts.\nAvoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches.\n\nGroup tokens\nUse \"grouping\" tokens in front of your branch names. \ngroup1/foo\ngroup2/foo\ngroup1/bar\ngroup2/bar\ngroup3/bar\ngroup1/baz\n\nThe groups can be named whatever you like to match your workflow.  I like to use short nouns for mine.  Read on for more clarity.\nShort well-defined tokens\nChoose short tokens so they do not add too much noise to every one of your branch names.  I use these:\nwip       Works in progress; stuff I know won't be finished soon\nfeat      Feature I'm adding or expanding\nbug       Bug fix or experiment\njunk      Throwaway branch created to experiment\n\nEach of these tokens can be used to tell you to which part of your workflow each branch belongs.\nIt sounds like you have multiple branches for different cycles of a change. I do not know what your cycles are, but let's assume they are 'new', 'testing' and 'verified'.  You can name your branches with abbreviated versions of these tags, always spelled the same way, to both group them and to remind you which stage you're in.\nnew/frabnotz\nnew/foo\nnew/bar\ntest/foo\ntest/frabnotz\nver/foo\n\nYou can quickly tell which branches have reached each different stage, and you can group them together easily using Git's pattern matching options.\n$ git branch --list \"test/*\"\ntest/foo\ntest/frabnotz\n\n$ git branch --list \"*/foo\"\nnew/foo\ntest/foo\nver/foo\n\n$ gitk --branches=\"*/foo\"\n\nUse slashes to separate parts\nYou may use most any delimiter you like in branch names, but I find slashes to be the most flexible. You might prefer to use dashes or dots.  But slashes let you do some branch renaming when pushing or fetching to/from a remote.\n$ git push origin 'refs/heads/feature/*:refs/heads/phord/feat/*'\n$ git push origin 'refs/heads/bug/*:refs/heads/review/bugfix/*'\n\nFor me, slashes also work better for tab expansion (command completion) in my shell.  The way I have it configured I can search for branches with different sub-parts by typing the first characters of the part and pressing the TAB key.  Zsh then gives me a list of branches which match the part of the token I have typed.  This works for preceding tokens as well as embedded ones.\n$ git checkout new<TAB>\nMenu:  new/frabnotz   new/foo   new/bar\n\n\n$ git checkout foo<TAB>\nMenu:  new/foo   test/foo   ver/foo\n\n(Zshell is very configurable about command completion and I could also configure it to handle dashes, underscores or dots the same way. But I choose not to.)\nIt also lets you search for branches in many git commands, like this:\ngit branch --list \"feature/*\"\ngit log --graph --oneline --decorate --branches=\"feature/*\" \ngitk --branches=\"feature/*\" \n\nCaveat: As Slipp points out in the comments, slashes can cause problems.  Because branches are implemented as paths, you cannot have a branch named \"foo\" and another branch named \"foo/bar\".  This can be confusing for new users.\nDo not use bare numbers\nDo not use use bare numbers (or hex numbers) as part of your branch naming scheme. Inside tab-expansion of a reference name, git may decide that a number is part of a sha-1 instead of a branch name.  For example, my issue tracker names bugs with decimal numbers.  I name my related branches CRnnnnn rather than just nnnnn to avoid confusion.  \n$ git checkout CR15032<TAB>\nMenu:   fix/CR15032    test/CR15032\n\nIf I tried to expand just 15032, git would be unsure whether I wanted to search SHA-1's or branch names, and my choices would be somewhat limited.\nAvoid long descriptive names\nLong branch names can be very helpful when you are looking at a list of branches.  But it can get in the way when looking at decorated one-line logs as the branch names can eat up most of the single line and abbreviate the visible part of the log.\nOn the other hand long branch names can be more helpful in \"merge commits\" if you do not habitually rewrite them by hand.  The default merge commit message is Merge branch 'branch-name'.  You may find it more helpful to have merge messages show up as Merge branch 'fix/CR15032/crash-when-unformatted-disk-inserted' instead of just Merge branch 'fix/CR15032'."}]}

We want to make our own master branch, so let's rename master to upstream-master.\ngit branch -m upstream-master\n\nNow use git subtree split to only include the part that you want. We'll make the split off part a new branch called upstream-skin.\ngit subtree split --prefix=addons/skin.confluence -b upstream-skin\ngit checkout upstream-skin\n\nThis gives you a new upstream-skin branch that only contains the contents of addons/skin.confluence, and with a filtered history that contains only the commits that modified files in addons/skin.confluence.\nNow, let's set up our remotes. Since you cloned xbmc/xbmc.git, the origin remote will point there. Let's rename that to upstream.\ngit remote rename origin upstream\n\nMake a repository on Github to contain your modifications to addons/skin.confluence. As an example, I'll use tbekolay/xbmc-skin, but replace this with your own repo. Add this repo as a remote, and push your upstream-skin branch to it.\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/tbekolay/xbmc-skin.git\ngit fetch origin\ngit push -u origin upstream-skin\n\nFinally, we'll make a new branch called master that will contain your changes.\ngit checkout -b master\ngit push -u origin master\n\nYou now have a \"fork\" of the addons/skin.confluence subdirectory.\nMaking changes to your repositories\nWhen you're dealing with your own local and remote repositories, you can use normal git commands. Make sure to do this on the master branch (or some other branch, if you'd like) and not the upstream-skin branch, which should only ever contain commits from the upstream project.\ngit checkout master\necho \"My XBMC Skin\" > README\ngit add README\ngit commit -m \"Added README\"\ngit push\n\nReceiving upstream commits\nWhen you're dealing with the upstream repository, you will have to use a mix of git and git subtree commands. To get new filtered commits, we need to do it in three stages.\nIn the first stage, we'll update upstream-master to the current version of the XBMC repository.\ngit checkout upstream-master\ngit pull\n\nThis should pull down new commits, if there are any.\nNext, we will update upstream-skin with the new filtered version of the commits. Since git subtree ensures that commit hashes will be the same, this should be a clean process. Note that you want to run these commands while still on the upstream-master branch.\ngit subtree split --prefix=addons/skin.confluence \\\n  --onto upstream-skin -b upstream-skin\n\nWith upstream-skin now updated, you can update your master branch as you see fit (either by merging or rebasing).\ngit checkout master\ngit rebase upstream-skin\n\n\nNote that the XBMC repository is gigantic, and the git subtree commands will take quite a bit of time to filter through all that history -- and since you're regenerating the split subtree each time you interact with the remote repository, it's quite an expensive operation. I'm not sure if this can be sped up.\nThis blog post goes into some more detail on the commands above. Also see the git-subtree docs for even more detail."}]}

When would one prefer one of these over the other?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others.\nWhereas Repo is simply a place where the history of your work is stored.\nThere is no good answer, it's personal preference. I make mine a conceptual distinction. If it's code designed to demonstrate a technique, teach a principle, or show off a solution it goes in a gist. Doesn't matter if it's one file or 30 files. If it's actual code intended to be run, used as is, or forked as boilerplate I put it in a proper repository."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between GitHub Flow and GitLab Flow?\n\nRecently I've found three concepts of a workflow in Git:\n\nGitFlow\nGitHub Flow\nGitLab Flow\n\nI've read the nice articles about it but I don't understand GitLab Flow very well.\nBriefly.\nGitFlow\n\nWe've a master branch as a production branch. Also we have a develop branch where every developer merges his features. Sometimes we create a release branch to deploy our features in production. If we have a bug in the release branch, fix it and pull changes into the develop branch. If we have a critical bug in production, create new hotfix-branch, fix the bug and merge branch with production (master) and develop branches.\nThis approach works well if we seldom publish results of our work. (Maybe once every 2 weeks).\nGitHub Flow\n\nWe have a master branch as a production branch. And we (as developers) can  create branches for adding new features or fixing bugs and merge them with production (master) branch. It sounds very simple. This approach fits for extreme programming where the production branch is deployed several times in a day.\nGitLab Flow\n\n\n\nI've seen new terms like a pre-production, a production, a release (stable) branch and a staging environment, a pre-production environment, a production environment. What relationships do they have between them?\nI understand it this way: If we need to add a new feature we deploy a pre-production branch from the master branch. When we have finished the feature, we deploy a production branch from the pre-production branch. A pre-production branch is the intermediate stage. And then the master branch pulls all changes from the production branch.\nThe approach is good if we want to see each separate feature; we just checkout in the branch what we need to look at.\nBut if we need to show our work we create a release branch with a tag as late as possible. If later we fix bugs in the master branch we need to cherry-pick them to the last release branch. At the end we have the release branch with tags that can help us to move between versions.\nIs my understanding correct?\nWhat is the difference between pull and cherry-pick?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It has been a year now since this post was raised, but considering future readers and the fact things have changed a bit I think it's worth refreshing.\nGitHub Flow as originally depicted by Scott Chacon in 2011 assumed each change once reviewed on a feature branch and merged into master should be deployed to production immediately. While this worked at the time and conformed to the only GitHub Flow rule, which is anything in the master branch is deployable, it was quickly discovered that in order to keep master a true record of known working production code the actual deployment to production should happen from the feature branch before merging it into master. Deploying from the feature branch makes perfect sense as in the case of any issue production can be instantaneously reverted by deploying master to it. Please take a look at a short visual introduction to GitHub Flow.\nGitLab Flow is kind of an extension to GitHub Flow accompanied by a set of guidelines and best practices that aim to further standardize the process. Aside from promoting ready to deploy master branch and feature branches (same as GitHub Flow) it introduces three other kinds of branches:\n\nProduction branch\nEnvironment branches: uat, pre-production, production\nRelease branches: 1-5-stable, 1-6-stable\n\nI believe above names and examples are self-descriptive, thus I won't elaborate further."}]}

The -p option uses the -i mechanism internally, so mixing the two doesn't really work.\nHowever, git rebase is just an automated way to do lots of cherry-picks.  You can replicate its behavior by manually cherry-picking to get a bit more control over the process.  It's less convenient and more prone to human error, but possible.\nThis is the approach I suggest:\n\nuse git rebase to get to the commit after the merge (the child of the merge)\nuse git reset --hard HEAD^ to manually get to the merge\nuse git commit --amend to repair the merge\nuse git cherry-pick to get back to the commit after the merge\nuse git rebase --continue to finish\n\nHere are the specific steps:\n\nNote the SHA1 ID of the merge commit you want to modify.  For discussion, suppose it is deadbeef.\nNote the SHA1 ID of the commit right after the merge commit you want to modify (the merge commit's child).  Suppose it is facef00d.\nRun git rebase -i deadbeef.\nSelect facef00d for editing.\nWhen rebase returns you to a prompt to edit facef00d, run git reset --hard HEAD^.  You should now be at deadbeef (git rev-parse HEAD should print deadbeef).\nMake your edits to fix the incorrect merge conflict and use git add to stage them.\nRun git commit --amend to fuse the staged fix with the bad merge commit.  The result will now have a different SHA1 (not deadbeef).\nRun git cherry-pick facef00d to apply the changes made by facef00d to the fixed merge commit.\nRun git rebase --continue to finish."}]}

It's entirely possible to use Git offline, with no connection to a centralized server, and the output of git status reflects this.\nCreating and switching branches (and checking their status) in Git is supposed to be lightweight, not something that performs a slow network operation to a centralized system. The assumption when designing Git, and the git status output, was that users understand this (too many Git features only make sense if you already know how Git works).

So here's my question:\nEvery now and then, I notice a bug in my code while working on an (unrelated) feature. A quick git blame then reveals that the bug has been introduced a few commits ago (I commit quite a lot, so usually it's not the most recent commit which introduced the bug). At this point, I usually do this:\ngit stash                      # temporarily put my work aside\ngit rebase -i <bad_commit>~1   # rebase one step before the bad commit\n                               # mark broken commit for editing\nvim <affected_sources>         # fix the bug\ngit add <affected_sources>     # stage fixes\ngit commit -C <bad_commit>     # commit fixes using same log message as before\ngit rebase --continue          # base all later changes onto this\n\nHowever, this happens so often that the above sequence is getting annoying.

My issue is this --- there are many (many) blog entries singing the praises of rebase and how it's changed their lives (see 1,2,3,4 to list a few), but none of them mentions that push --force is part of their flow.  However, nearly every answer to the existing stackoverflow questions say things like \"yeah, if you're gonna rebase, ya gotta use push --force\".\nGiven the number and religiosity of rebase advocates, I have to believe that using 'push --force' is not an inherent part of a rebase flow, and that if one often has to force their pushes, they're doing something wrong.\npush --force is a bad thing.\nSo here's my flow.  In what way could I achieve the same results without a force?\nSimple Example\nTwo branches:\n\nv1.0 - a release branch, contains only patches\nmaster - everything for the next major release.\n\nI've got a few patch commits and a few commits for the next release.\n\nI'd like to incorporate the patches into my master so that they're not lost for the next release.  Pre-enlightenment I'd simply:\ngit checkout master\ngit merge v1.0\n\nBut now I'm trying\ngit checkout master\ngit rebase v1.0\n\nSo now I'm here:\n\nTime for:\ngit push\n\nNo dice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rebasing is a great tool, but it works best when you use it to create fast-forward merges for topic branches onto master.

For example:\ngit checkout master\ngit merge --ff-only add-new-widget\n\nThe benefit of this is that your history won't have a lot of complex merge commits or merge conflicts, because all your changes will be rebased onto the tip of master before the merge. A secondary benefit is that you've rebased, but you don't have to use git push --force because you are not clobbering history on the master branch.\nThat's certainly not the only use case for rebase, or the only workflow, but it's one of the more sensible uses for it that I've seen.

Everything accessible to React (even if you embed it through a build step) will later be visible in the front-end code and someone relatively basic to find.

(After the setting, you can use environment variables like this in your project.)\nconst apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_APIKey\nconst apiSecret = process.env.REACT_APP_APISecret\n\nTo add a secret to your repository, go to your repository's Setting > Secrets, click on Add a new secret. In the screenshot below, I added 2 env variables: REACT_APP_APIKey and REACT_APP_APISecret.\nNotice: All the environment variable you want to access with create-react-app need to be prefixed with REACT_APP.\n\nAfter you have your secret ready, you can take a look at this post, it's about how to add your own Action upon push.\nTo setup your action script, go to your repository > Actions, an click on Setup workflow your self, and paste in the script provided in the post or take a look at mine script below.\n\nI use the following script to access the 2 environment variables I set on GitHub secret. (You can access the secret you set in the script by ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_APIKey }}.)\nname: CI\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    \n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v1\n\n    - name: Build\n      run: |\n        npm install\n        npm run-script build\n      env:\n        REACT_APP_APIKey: ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_APIKey }}\n        REACT_APP_APISecret: ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_APISecret }}\n\n    - name: Deploy\n      uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3\n      with:\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        BRANCH: gh-pages\n        FOLDER: build\n\n\nAfter you setup the script, the action will be triggered by any push to master\nbranch. After you push any commits, you can take a look at the deployment status at actions status.\nYou can see how hard it is for me to figure it out... so many fail attempts lol.

I created a branch for that called 'generalmaintenance', did the job and then switched to develop and merged it in. I now want to return to 'newfeature' branch and to merge in the changes that I merged into it earlier.\nWhen I switched to 'newfeature' and merged in 'develop', there were conflicts in 3 files.\nI got in a tangle resolving the conflicts and eventually decided to use the \"Revert\" command in the 'Team' menu of Aptana Studio 3 (which is my IDE). I expected this to roll me back to before the merge, which it appears to have done.\nAnyway, when I merge in 'develop' again, it says, Already-up-to-date, but when comparing files between the two branches, they are very different and the changes I added in the other branch are not being merged in.\nHow will I merge the two branches now please?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reverting Merges vs. Resetting Merges\nMy guess is that you actually are Already-up-to-date. \nThe problem is that git revert doesn't undo the merge, it only undoes the changes that the merge brought with it. When you create a merge commit, you're combining the commit histories of those two branches.\nMerging\n     develop\n        |\nA---B---C\n \\       \\\n  E---F---M\n          |\n      newfeature\n\nIn the case above, develop is merged into newfeature, creating the M commit. If you were to run git log newfeature you would see all the commits from both branches, however from the perspective of the newfeature branch, all those changes were performed by the M commit.\nReverting\nThe git revert command does not remove any commits, instead it creates a new commit that undoes the changes that the commit contained. For example if you had a commit containing this diff...\n-This is the old sentence.\n+This is the new sentence.\n\nThen reverted this, the revert command would create a new commit that just preformed the opposite diff, it simply flips the signs.\n-This is the new sentence.\n+This is the old sentence.\n\nThis is really useful for undoing damage caused by commits that other developers already have. It moves history forward rather than changing history. \nReverting Merges\nHowever, in the context of a non-fastforward merge it may have an undesired effect.\n     develop\n        |\nA---B---C\n \\       \\\n  E---F---M---W\n              |\n         newfeature\n\nAssuming W is a reversion commit, you can see how running git log newfeature will still include all the commits from the develop branch. As a result, additional merges from develop will no work, because it doesn't see anything missing from your branch.\nUsing git reset instead of revert.\nIn the future, you might want to consider using git reset --hard <ref> (where <ref> is the commit hash of the merge) to undo a merge if that merge has not been shared with other developers. In the example above, after having created merge commit M, running the command git reset --hard F would result in the following.\n     develop\n        |\nA---B---C\n \\       \\\n  E---F---M\n      |\n  newfeature\n\nAs you can see this technique doesn't obliterate the commit as some people tend to think, it simply moves your branch back to the commit you selected. Now if you ran git log newfeature you would only get commit F, E, and A. Now the merge is actually gone from your branches history, so a later attempts to re-merge in develop will cause no problems.\nThis method is not without its complications. Realize that you are now modifying history, so if the newfeature branch was pushed to a remote branch after the M merge was made, then git is going to think you are simply out of date and tell you that you need to run git pull. If its just you working on that remote branch, then feel free to force-push - git push -f <remote> <branch>. This will have the same effect of the reset but on the remote branch.\nIf this branch is being used by multiple developers, who would have by now already pulled from it - then this is a bad idea. This is the very reason git revert is useful, because it undoes changes without changing the actual history.\nUsing reset on history is really only on option for commits that have not been shared. \nThe solution - reverting the reversion.\nIf the merge commit has already been shared, then the best approach is probably to use git revert on that merge. However as we said before, you can not then simply merge the branch back in and expect all the changes from that branch to re-appear. The answer is to revert the revert commit. \nLets say you did some work on the develop branch after having revered the merge in newfeature. Your history would look something like this.\n         develop\n            |\nA---B---C---D\n \\       \\\n  E---F---M---W\n              |\n         newfeature\n\nIf you merge develop into newfeature now, you would only get D because its the only commit that is not already part of the history of the newfeature branch. What you also need to do is revert that W commit - git revert W should do the trick followed by git merge develop. \n                 develop\n                    |\nA---B---C-----------D\n \\       \\           \\\n  E---F---M---W---M---G\n                      |\n                 newfeature\n\nThis restores all the changes made by the original merge commit - which were actually made by C and B but were reverted in W, it then brings in D via a new merge commit G I would recommend reverting the revert before merging in the recent changes to develop, I suspect doing it in that order will have a lower chance of triggering conflicts.\nTL;DR\nReverting creates a 'revert commit'. When undoing a revert, you need to run the revert command on the revert commit that was created when you reverted the first time. It should be easy enough to find, git tends to auto-comment on reverts so that they start with the word \"Reverted\".\ngit revert <commit>"}]}

While \u201cmaster\u201d is the default name for a starting branch when you run git init which is the only reason it\u2019s widely used, \u201corigin\u201d is the default name for a remote when you run git clone. If you run git clone -o booyah instead, then you will have booyah/master as your default remote branch.\n\nThat means, we can use our default branch name as main or main-branch or something like that. I didn't see any option in man git-init which will initialize my repo with a different default branch name.\nGitHub shows how to set the default branch name in its settings page.

These two commands create a new Git repo with a branch named \"trunk\", which always made more sense to me than \"master\" (master of what?):\ngit init --initial-branch=trunk\ngit init -b trunk\n\nThis is configurable with the init.defaultBranch setting. If I want all new repos to have \"trunk\" as the default branch:\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch trunk\n\nOlder Git, New Repo\nSome systems still have older Git installations. My Debian 10 server (Buster, the current stable version as of October 2020) comes with Git 2.20, which does not support the -b option. One option is to create the repository and then change the branch name. This technique works for normal (non-bare) repos:\ngit init\ngit checkout -b trunk\n\nThis creates a new repository with trunk as the current branch instead of master.  The branch master does not actually exist--the branches don't get created until they have at least one commit.  Until the branch gets created, the branch only exists in .git/HEAD, which explains why the master branch will disappear when you switch to trunk.\nBare Repos\nFor bare repos, you cannot run git checkout (that's what it means to be bare). Instead, you can change HEAD to point at a different branch:\ngit init --bare\ngit symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/trunk\n\nOld Repos\nIf you've already committed, you can run git branch -m instead:\ngit init\ntouch file.txt\ngit add file.txt\ngit commit -m 'commit 1'\ngit branch -m trunk\n\nThis renames the branch from master to trunk once it's created.\nThis does seem a bit clunky since the mechanism is different depending on whether the repository is empty, but it works.

How does it differ from the default behavior (without that flag)? What does it mean to \"recreate\" a merge, etc."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As with a normal git rebase, git with --preserve-merges first identifies a list of commits made in one part of the commit graph, and then replays those commits on top of another part. The differences with --preserve-merges concern which commits are selected for replay and how that replaying works for merge commits.\nTo be more explicit about the main differences between normal and merge-preserving rebase:\n\nMerge-preserving rebase is willing to replay (some) merge commits, whereas normal rebase completely ignores merge commits.\nBecause it's willing to replay merge commits, merge-preserving rebase has to define what it means to replay a merge commit, and deal with some extra wrinkles\n\n\nThe most interesting part, conceptually, is perhaps in picking what the new commit's merge parents should be. \nReplaying merge commits also require explicitly checking out particular commits (git checkout <desired first parent>), whereas normal rebase doesn't have to worry about that.\n\nMerge-preserving rebase considers a shallower set of commits for replay:\n\n\nIn particular, it will only consider replaying commits made since the most recent merge base(s) -- i.e. the most recent time the two branches diverged --, whereas normal rebase might replay commits going back to the first time the two branches diverged.\nTo be provisional and unclear, I believe this is ultimately a means to screen out replaying \"old commits\" that have already been \"incorporated into\" a merge commit.\n\n\nFirst I will try to describe \"sufficiently exactly\" what rebase --preserve-merges does, and then there will be some examples. One can of course start with the examples, if that seems more useful.\nThe Algorithm in \"Brief\"\nIf you want to really get into the weeds, download the git source and explore the file git-rebase--interactive.sh. (Rebase is not part of Git's C core, but rather is written in bash. And, behind the scenes, it shares code with \"interactive rebase\".)\nBut here I will sketch what I think is the essence of it. In order to reduce the number of things to think about, I have taken a few liberties. (e.g. I don't try to capture with 100% accuracy the precise order in which computations take place, and ignore some less central-seeming topics, e.g. what to do about commits that have already been cherry-picked between branches).\nFirst, note that a non-merge-preserving rebase is rather simple. It's more or less:\nFind all commits on B but not on A (\"git log A..B\")\nReset B to A (\"git reset --hard A\") \nReplay all those commits onto B one at a time in order.\n\nRebase --preserve-merges is comparatively complicated. Here's as simple as I've been able to make it without losing things that seem pretty important:\nFind the commits to replay:\n  First find the merge-base(s) of A and B (i.e. the most recent common ancestor(s))\n    This (these) merge base(s) will serve as a root/boundary for the rebase.\n    In particular, we'll take its (their) descendants and replay them on top of new parents\n  Now we can define C, the set of commits to replay. In particular, it's those commits:\n    1) reachable from B but not A (as in a normal rebase), and ALSO\n    2) descendants of the merge base(s)\n  If we ignore cherry-picks and other cleverness preserve-merges does, it's more or less:\n    git log A..B --not $(git merge-base --all A B)\nReplay the commits:\n  Create a branch B_new, on which to replay our commits.\n  Switch to B_new (i.e. \"git checkout B_new\")\n  Proceeding parents-before-children (--topo-order), replay each commit c in C on top of B_new:\n    If it's a non-merge commit, cherry-pick as usual (i.e. \"git cherry-pick c\")\n    Otherwise it's a merge commit, and we'll construct an \"equivalent\" merge commit c':\n      To create a merge commit, its parents must exist and we must know what they are.\n      So first, figure out which parents to use for c', by reference to the parents of c:\n        For each parent p_i in parents_of(c):\n          If p_i is one of the merge bases mentioned above:\n            # p_i is one of the \"boundary commits\" that we no longer want to use as parents\n            For the new commit's ith parent (p_i'), use the HEAD of B_new.\n          Else if p_i is one of the commits being rewritten (i.e. if p_i is in R):\n            # Note: Because we're moving parents-before-children, a rewritten version\n            # of p_i must already exist. So reuse it:\n            For the new commit's ith parent (p_i'), use the rewritten version of p_i.\n          Otherwise:\n            # p_i is one of the commits that's *not* slated for rewrite. So don't rewrite it\n            For the new commit's ith parent (p_i'), use p_i, i.e. the old commit's ith parent.\n      Second, actually create the new commit c':\n        Go to p_1'. (i.e. \"git checkout p_1'\", p_1' being the \"first parent\" we want for our new commit)\n        Merge in the other parent(s):\n          For a typical two-parent merge, it's just \"git merge p_2'\".\n          For an octopus merge, it's \"git merge p_2' p_3' p_4' ...\".\n        Switch (i.e. \"git reset\") B_new to the current commit (i.e. HEAD), if it's not already there\n  Change the label B to apply to this new branch, rather than the old one. (i.e. \"git reset --hard B\")\n\nRebase with an --onto C argument should be very similar. Just instead of starting commit playback at the HEAD of B, you start commit playback at the HEAD of C instead. (And use C_new instead of B_new.)\nExample 1\nFor example, take commit graph\n  B---C <-- master\n /                     \nA-------D------E----m----H <-- topic\n         \\         /\n          F-------G\n\nm is a merge commit with parents E and G.\nSuppose we rebased topic (H) on top of master (C) using a normal, non-merge-preserving\nrebase. (For example, checkout topic; rebase master.) In that case, git would select\nthe following commits for replay:\n\npick D\npick E\npick F\npick G\npick H\n\nand then update the commit graph like so:\n  B---C <-- master\n /     \\                \nA       D'---E'---F'---G'---H' <-- topic\n\n(D' is the replayed equivalent of D, etc..)\nNote that merge commit m is not selected for replay.\nIf we instead did a --preserve-merges rebase of H on top of C. (For example, checkout topic; rebase --preserve-merges master.) In this new case, git would select the following commits for replay:\n\npick D\npick E\npick F (onto D' in the 'subtopic' branch)\npick G (onto F' in the 'subtopic' branch)\npick Merge branch 'subtopic' into topic\npick H\n\nNow m was chosen for replay. Also note that merge parents E and G were\npicked for inclusion before merge commit m.\nHere is the resulting commit graph:\n B---C <-- master\n/     \\                \nA      D'-----E'----m'----H' <-- topic\n        \\          / \n         F'-------G'\n\nAgain, D' is a cherry-picked (i.e. recreated) version of D. Same for E', etc.. Every commit not on master has been replayed. Both E and G (the merge parents of m) have been recreated as E' and G' to serve as the parents of m' (after rebase, the tree history still remains the same).\nExample 2\nUnlike with normal rebase, merge-preserving rebase can create multiple\nchildren of the upstream head.\nFor example, consider:\n  B---C <-- master\n /                     \nA-------D------E---m----H <-- topic\n \\                 |\n  ------- F-----G--/ \n\nIf we rebase H (topic) on top of C (master), then the commits chosen for rebase are:\n\npick D\npick E\npick F\npick G\npick m\npick H\n\nAnd the result is like so:\n  B---C  <-- master\n /    | \\                \nA     |  D'----E'---m'----H' <-- topic\n       \\            |\n         F'----G'---/\n\nExample 3\nIn the above examples, both the merge commit and its two parents are replayed commits, rather than the original parents that the original merge commit have. However, in other rebases a replayed merge commit can end up with parents that were already in the commit graph before the merge.\nFor example, consider:\n  B--C---D <-- master\n /    \\                \nA---E--m------F <-- topic\n\nIf we rebase topic onto master (preserving merges), then the commits to replay will be\n\npick merge commit m\npick F\n\nThe rewritten commit graph will look like so:\n                     B--C--D <-- master\n                    /       \\             \n                   A-----E---m'--F'; <-- topic\n\nHere replayed merge commit m' gets parents that pre-existed in the commit graph, namely D (the HEAD of master) and E (one of the parents of the original merge commit m).\nExample 4\nMerge-preserving rebase can get confused in certain \"empty commit\" cases. At least this is true only some older versions of git (e.g. 1.7.8.)\nTake this commit graph:\n                   A--------B-----C-----m2---D <-- master\n                    \\        \\         /\n                      E--- F--\\--G----/\n                            \\  \\\n                             ---m1--H <--topic\n\nNote that both commit m1 and m2 should have incorporated all the changes from B and F.\nIf we try to do git rebase --preserve-merges of H (topic) onto D (master), then the following commits are chosen for replay:\n\npick m1\npick H\n\nNote that the changes (B, F) united in m1 should already be incorporated into D. (Those changes should already be incorporated into m2, because m2 merges together the children of B and F.) Therefore, conceptually, replaying m1 on top of D should probably either be a no-op or create an empty commit (i.e. one where the diff between successive revisions is empty).\nInstead, however, git may reject the attempt to replay m1 on top of D. You can get an error like so:\nerror: Commit 90caf85 is a merge but no -m option was given.\nfatal: cherry-pick failed\n\nIt looks like one forgot to pass a flag to git, but the underlying problem is that git dislikes creating empty commits."}]}

This is the moment to run every test you can think of.\nIf all is working out, merge the feature or fix into the stable branch. Now the change is live for your customers.\n\nGetting the code on the server\nThe updating of servers shouldn't be a problem. Basically I would set them up as users just like you're developers are. At my company we've setup the servers as read-only users. Basically that means the servers can never push anything but can always pull. Setting this up isn't trivial though, so you could just as well build a simple webinterface which simply only allows a git pull. If you can keep your developers from doing stuff on live implementations you're safe :)\n[EDIT]\nIn response to the last questions asked in the comments of this reaction:\nI don't know if I understand your question correctly, but basically (simplified a bit) this is how I would do this, were I in you shoes.\n\nThe testing machine (or the webroot which acts as testing implementation) has it source code based in a git repository with the master branch checked out. While creating this repository you could even remove all other references to all other branches so you'll be sure no can checkout a wrong branch in this repository. So basically the testing machine has a Git repository with only a master branch which is checked out.\nFor the live servers I would do exactly the same, but this time with the stable branch checked out. Developer should have a local repository cloned in which all branches exist. And a local implementation of the software you guys build. This software gets its source from a the local git repository. In other words: from the currently checked out branch in this repository.\nActual coding\nWhen a new feature is wanted, a local feature branch can be made based on the current master. When the branch is checked out the changes can be made and checked locally by the developer (since the software is now running on the source of the feature branch).\nIf everything seems to be in order, the changes get merged from feature branch to master and pushed to your \"git machine\". \"your github\" so to speak. Testing can now pull the changes in so every test necessary can be done by QA. If they decide everything is ok, the developer can merge the changes from master to stable and push again.\nAll thats left now is pulling form your live machines."}]}

You can clone and checkout lib1 and lib2 with one command:\ngit submodule update\n\nNow you are able to refactor code1.js without import errors.\nSubmodules are just references to certain commits. So when you want to update libraries to new versions, you have to update the references.

So you just run the command below.\ngit submodule init sub-project1 sub-project2\n\nAnd like I mentioned in workflow1, you need to run the command below to clone and checkout them.\ngit submodule update\n\nWould I do git submodule update --remote in this case? Or do I even have to init and update submodules to refactor code in the shared directory? Yes, because you have to run tests in submodules after refactoring the shared code and if any update of submodules is committed and pushed to the remote repository while you are refactoring, then you need to get it by git submodule update --remote."}]}

It's not possible to create a tar/zip directly, you have to do in two steps (export + zip).

You can specify a different name if you prefer:\nsvn export https://github.com/username/projectname/trunk projectname\n\nYou can use this technique to export any sub-directory of the project.\nFor example if you want only some/path, you can do:\nsvn export https://github.com/username/projectname/trunk/some/path local-dir-name\n\nYou can get paths from branches and tags too. The endpoint https://github.com/username/projectname behaves fully as a Subversion repository with a regular layout, so you will find branches in https://github.com/username/projectname/branches and tags in https://github.com/username/projectname/tags.\nBefore you export something large by mistake, it's good to check first the content of the path.

You've pushed and other people have your bad changes.\nYou want to undo it. It\u2019s not something you can hand-undo in code yourself, say some wizard or package manager changed tons of stuff all over the place - you just want to put it all back how it was.\nThis is what source control is all about.

Using git revert:\n$ git revert HEAD\n[master 1db4eeb] Revert \"bad update\"\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\nThere will be 3 commits in the log:\n$ git log --oneline\n1db4eeb Revert \"bad update\"\na1b9870 bad update\n3f7522e initial commit\n\nSo there is a consistent history of what has happened, yet the files are as if the bad update never occured:\ncat README.md \nInitial text\n\nIt doesn't matter where in the history the commit to be reverted is (in the above example, the last commit is reverted - any commit can be reverted).\nClosing questions\n\ndo you have to do something else after?\n\nA git revert is just another commit, so e.g. push to the remote so that other users can pull/fetch/merge the changes and you're done.\n\nDo you have to commit the changes revert made or does revert directly commit to the repo?\n\ngit revert is a commit - there are no extra steps assuming reverting a single commit is what you wanted to do.\n\nObviously, you'll need to push again and probably announce your balls-up to the team.\n\nIndeed - if the remote is in an unstable state - communicating to the rest of the team that they need to pull to get the fix (the reverting commit) would be the right thing to do :)."}]}

You have two branches to work with, your feature1 branch is basically the \"develop\" branch in the GitFlow model.\nYou created a hotfix branch from master and merged it back.

They might conflict with other development changes in the branch, but they will not conflict with the master branch should you merge the feature branch back to master eventually.\nBe very careful with rebasing. Only rebase if the changes you did stayed local to your repository, e.g. you did not push any branches to some other repository.

If the output of:\n git config core.sharedRepository\n\nis not group or true or 1 or some mask, try running:\n git config core.sharedRepository group\n\nand then re-run the recursive chmod and chgrp (see \"Repair Permissions\" above).\n\nThe operating system doesn't interpret a setgid bit on directories as \"all new files and subdirectories should inherit the group owner\".\nWhen core.sharedRepository is true or group, Git relies on a feature of GNU operating systems (e.g., every Linux distribution) to ensure that newly created subdirectories are owned by the correct group (the group that all of the repository's users are in).  This feature is documented in the GNU coreutils documentation:\n\n... [If] a directory's set-group-ID bit is set, newly created subfiles inherit the same group as the directory, and newly created subdirectories inherit the set-group-ID bit of the parent directory. ... [This mechanism lets] users share files more easily, by lessening the need to use chmod or chown to share new files.\n\nHowever, not all operating systems have this feature (NetBSD is one example).  For those operating systems, you should make sure that all of your Git users have the same default group.  Alternatively, you can make the repository world-writable by running git config core.sharedRepository world (but be careful\u2014this is less secure).\n\nThe file system doesn't support the setgid bit (e.g., FAT).  ext2, ext3, ext4 all support the setgid bit.  As far as I know, the file systems that don't support the setgid bit also don't support the concept of group ownership so all files and directories will be owned by the same group anyway (which group is a mount option).  In this case, make sure all Git users are in the group that owns all the files in the file system.\n\nNot all of the Git users are in the same group that owns the repository directories.  Make sure the group owner on the directories is correct and that all users are in that group."}]}

I know they are getting a lot of bashing around the internet but since I assume the git developers are smart people there must a reason for the current behavior - and maybe a way to work around my problem.\nSo, I have a project and some submodules. The project have different branches, like:\n\nMyApp_version2\nMyApp_version3\nMyApp_version4\nMyApp_liteversion\nMyApp_development\n\nMy submodules doesn't update that often (maybe once a week) so I'm fine with them not being attached to the head of the submodule repository automatically.\nHowever, when I check out an old branch - because I need to fix a bug in an old version of the software - I also need to update the submodules.\nWhy do I need to do this?\nI would expect git to work like svn. When I commit my work in my main repo I would expect git to think something along these lines: \"OK, he wants to commit his work now. I can see the submodules are currently at revision abc so when he at some point in the future get's back to this commit he probably wants the submodules at the same revision again.\"\nI can not see a single case where you would want the submodules to stay at the current revision while you go back 3 years in your main repository. However, there must be a reason for this implementation, right?\nI would really like to hear if any of you know the thoughts behind this, but in any case I would really like a solution. Is there a way to tell git: \"I want to commit this work with these submodules. If I at some point go back to this state I want the submodules to be checked out at the correct version as well.\"\nExample for clarification\nMy main repository is an application which needs to use SSL, and I find a SSL library (libSSL) I add as a submodule.\nOn Oct. 31 2010 I create a commit in my main repository (2fd4e1) while the submodule points to libSSL version 3 (c67a2d).\nTime passes, libSSl gets updated to version 34, I adapt my code, life it good.\nOn May 14 2013 I create a new commit (28fced) and submodule points to the most recent version of libSSL (849ee1).\nHowever, if I check out 2fd4e1 my submodule will stay at 849ee1 even though the original commit was created with c67a2d.

The changes are needed, but not as part of a new commit. For example, 1 file was added locally, 100 files came from merge. The new commit should have 1 changed file and not 101 changed file. This is especially important if an automatic merge is not possible, but a pull request is initiated and someone has to review the commit. You want the reviewer to review 1 file, not 101 files.\nWhat I am currently doing is this: let's say we have branch 'master' and 'feature'. 'feature' is created from 'master' and I only make changes to files in 'feature'. When new changes are pulled into 'master', git merge master inside 'feature' will introduce new files (and these are staged automatically in VSCode, which is the IDE I use).\nWhat I do next is unstage all of these files. Basically ignore them. Only add and commit files that I change. Push 'feature' to origin/remote repo, create pull request.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to have a Gitlab CI Pipeline run some jobs always and other jobs only on merge-requests?\n\nTL/DR: \nMy goal is to have a Gitlab (CE-12.4.2) pipeline that executes some jobs only on merge-requests and other jobs always (on merge-requests and on all normal pushes). How must the .gitlab-ci.yml look to do this?\nMy use-case: \nI have a big pipeline running a lot of jobs (tests, validation, dep's, build, doc's, ...). Now I have added a staging environment (using kubernetes) and have the pipeline build a new image and deploy that in the staging-environment. This allows me to instantly open up the changed (web-)application and see how the changes behave and look without having to check them out locally. Now building an image and deploying it to staging would be much too resource-heavy to do for every push, so I only want deployments to staging when someone creates a merge-request for me to review.\nA very simplified example:\ninstall:\n  script: ...\n\ntest:\n  script: ...\n\nbuild-image:\n  script: ...\n  only: [merge_requests]\n\ndeploy-staging:\n  script: ...\n  only: [merge_requests]\n\nFor all normal pushes, the jobs install and test should be executed.\nFor merge-requests, the jobs install, test, build-image and deploy-staging should be executed.\nWhat i have tried: Gitlab has this feature to define only: [merge_requests] on a job, this causes that job to only be executed when the pipeline is executed for a merge-request. Sounds like exactly what I am looking for, but there is a big catch. Once that attribute is applied to one job in a pipeline, all other jobs in that pipeline that do not have that attribute will be removed from the pipeline when executed inside merge-requests. That seemed like a bug to me at first, but is actually documented behaviour:\nIn the above example, the pipeline contains only a test job. Since the build and deploy jobs don\u2019t have the only: [merge_requests] parameter, they will not run in the merge request.\n\nIn order to re-introduce all the other jobs to the pipeline for merge-requests, I have to apply only: [merge_requests] to all other jobs. The problem with that approach is that now these regular jobs do not get executed for normal git-pushes anymore. And I have no way to re-introduce these regular jobs to pipelines for normal pushes, because Gitlab has no support for only: [always] or anything like that.\nNow I also have noticed that the only syntax is candidate for deprecation and one should prefer the rules syntax instead, so I took a look at that. There are multiple problems with that approach: \n\nThe only way to detect with rules whether the pipeline is executed for a merge-request or not is to evaluate the variables related to merge-requests, like $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID. Unfortunately these variables only exist when only: [merge_requests] is used, which would re-introduce the above problems.\nRules only allow the conditional application of other attributes, so I still would have to use only, except or when attributes to actually remove or add jobs from or to the pipeline. Unfortunately Gitlab does not support anything like only: [never] or when: never, so i have no way to actually remove or add the jobs.\n\nI also tried to have the jobs depend on another using need or dependencies attributes, this seemed to have no effect on whether the job is included to the pipeline or not.\nThe last thing I desperately tried was including all jobs always and just mark them as when: manual to be triggered manually by pushing a button. This somewhat works, but is very tedious because the deployment to staging is a multi-job process with every job taking quite some time to finish. So I would see a merge-request, push the button for the first job, wait 5 minutes, press the next button, wait 5 minutes again, and only then am able to use the staging. For many small merge-requests, this would take up a lot of my time and would not be a efficient solution. I also cannot just mark the first of these jobs as manual because Gitlab will then just skip that job and execute that later ones out of order (And again, needs and dependencies seem to have no effect on this when dealing with manually triggered jobs).\nWhat i am a bit baffled about is that after searching the net, I have found nobody having the same problem. Either I am the only Gitlab User that wants to execute some jobs only for merge-requests without excluding all other jobs (which seems highly unlikely) or I am missing something obvious (which seems more likely). Am I missing something or does Gitlab really not support this use-case?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From the previous answer:\n\nBut there is a problem.

They could use git log -g to find the commit just before they pulled your deletion.\n\nIn a comment, you mention that the file you want to \u201cuntrack, but keep\u201d is some kind of configuration file that is required for running the software (directly out of a repository).\nKeep File as a \u2018Default\u2019 and Manually/Automatically Activate It\nIf it is not completely unacceptable to continue to maintain the configuration file's content in the repository, you might be able to rename the tracked file from (e.g.) foo.conf to foo.conf.default and then instruct your users to cp foo.conf.default foo.conf after applying the rename commit.\nOr, if the users already use some existing part of the repository (e.g. a script or some other program configured by content in the repository (e.g. Makefile or similar)) to launch/deploy your software, you could incorporate a defaulting mechanism into the launch/deploy process:\ntest -f foo.conf || test -f foo.conf.default &&\n    cp foo.conf.default foo.conf\n\nWith such a defaulting mechanism in place, users should be able to pull a commit that renames foo.conf to foo.conf.default without having to do any extra work.\nAlso, you avoid having to manually copy a configuration file if you make additional installations/repositories in the future.\nRewriting History Requires Manual Intervention Anyway\u2026\nIf it is unacceptable to maintain the content in the repository then you will likely want to completely eradicate it from history with something like git filter-branch --index-filter \u2026.\nThis amounts to rewriting history, which will require manual intervention for each branch/repository (see \u201cRecovering From Upstream Rebase\u201d section in the git rebase manpage).\nThe special treatment required for your configuration file would be just another step that one must perform while recovering from the rewrite:\n\nSave a copy of the configuration file.\nRecover from the rewrite.\nRestore the configuration file.\n\n\nIgnore It to Prevent Recurrence\nWhatever method you use, you will probably want to include the configuration filename in a .gitignore file in the repository so that no one can inadvertently git add foo.conf again (it is possible, but requires -f/--force).\nIf you have more than one configuration file, you might consider \u2018moving\u2019 them all into a single directory and ignoring the whole thing (by \u2018moving\u2019 I mean changing where the program expects to find its configuration files, and getting the users (or the launch/deploy mechanism) to copy/move the files to to their new location; you obviously would not want to git mv a file into a directory that you will be ignoring)."}]}

The merge commit is m2.\nfeature-B is ready to ship, so someone merges it into master. git tries to determine the merge base, but m1 and A both qualify equally as merge bases. git merges m1 and A in a temporary merge branch, which results in a conflict. We see diff3 output in the merged common ancestors section, similar to the OP's question.\n\nReading the output\nWith diff3 off, this merge conflict would look simply like this:\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n    aaaaaa\n=======\n    hhhhhh\n>>>>>>> mybranch\n\nFirst, with all the extra markers, you'll want to determine what the actual conflicting lines are, so you can differentiate it from the diff3 common ancestor output.\n\naaaaaahhhhhh, that's a little better. ;-)\nIn the case where two conflict resolutions are conflicting, aaaaaa and hhhhhh are the two resolutions.\nNext, examine the content of the merged common ancestor.\n\nWith this particular merge history, there were more than 2 merge bases, which required multiple temporary merge branches which were then merged together. The result when there are many merge bases and conflicts can get pretty hairy and difficult to read. Some say don't bother, just turn off diff3 for these situations.\nAlso be aware that git internally may decide to use different merge strategies to auto-resolve conflicts, so the output can be hard to understand. Make sense out of it if you can, but know that it was not intended for human consumption. In this case, a conflict occurred when merging mybranch into Temporary merge branch 1 between bbbbbb and cccccc. Line dddddd had no conflicts between the temporary merge branches. Then a separate conflict occurred when merging Temporary merge branch 2 into HEAD, with multiple common ancestors. HEAD had resolved the conflict by merging ffffff and gggggg as eeeeee, but Temporary merge branch 2 resolved that same conflict by deleting (or moving) the line (thus no lines between ====== and Temporary merge branch 2.\nHow do you resolve a conflict like this? While technical analysis may be possible, your safest option is usually to go back and review the history in all the involved branches around the conflict, and manually craft a resolution based on your understanding.\nAvoiding all this\nThese conflicts are the worst, but there are some behaviors that will help prevent them.\n\nAvoid criss-cross merges. In the example above, feature-B merged origin/master as B0. It's possible that this merge to stay up-to-date with master wasn't necessary (though sometimes it is). If origin/master was never merged into feature-B, there would have been no merge criss-cross, and m3 would have been a normal conflict with A as the only merge base.\nm3 *              m3 *\n   |\\                |\\\n   | \\               | \\\n   |  * B1           |  * B1\n   |  |              |  |\nm2 *  * B0   VS   m2 *  |\n   |\\/|              |\\ |\n   |/\\|              | \\|\nm1 *  * A         m1 *  * A\n   | /               | /\n   |/                |/\nm0 *              m0 *\n\nBe consistent with conflict resolutions. In the example, the Temporary merge base conflict only occurred because m2 and B0 had different conflict resolutions. If they had resolved the conflict identically, m3 would have been a clean merge. Realize though that this is a simple criss-cross merge that ought to have had the same resolution. Other situations may rightly have different resolutions. Things get more complicated when there are more than 2 merge bases and multiple commits between the merge points. That said, if you are knowingly inconsistent with conflict resolutions in criss-cross situations, expect headaches later."}]}

In other words, committing to that submodule should update all various repositories (repositories, not just clones) that use this same submodule.\n---- EDIT ----\nVisibly my checked-out repository was messed up and broken.

A git checkout master may be required if it's on a detached head."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Short answer: \ncd ProjectFooBarCommoneSubmodule\ngit checkout master\n<Do your editing>\ngit commit --all -m \"Lots of fixes\"\ngit push submodule_origin master\ncd ..\n\ngit add ProjectFooBarCommoneSubmodule\ngit commit -m \"Bumped up the revision of ProjectFooBarCommoneSubmodule\"\ngit push origin master\n\nThe longer one: \nGit submodules are a dependency mechanism, where the main project (say A) defines a specified revision in a subproject (say B), which will be used in building project A. In order for the tool to be useful the behavior has to be predictable from A:s point of view. Dependencies cannot change, unless somebody decides to incorporate the change to project A. All kinds of nasty things could happen, were project B:s changes automatically imported, of which compile errors are probably the best ones, as A would notice the failures immediately. This is why B:s head is kept in detached state. \nThe state of B is store in A (check out git submodule status), and a revision change has to be done and committed in A, in order for it to have any effect. This is what happens in the example above, A changes the revision number stored in the repo, and bumps up the version to the latest one. The process will have to be repeated in the other main repo as well, so no automatic \"use master\" switch AFAIK.\nBTW. The Git book chapter on submodules and the submodule man page contain lots of useful info about submodules, as normal usage and typical pitfalls as well. Worth checking out.\n\nEDIT: I'll try to explain this better\nI took the liberty to create example projects on my github account. The commits are meaningless and contain junk, but the setup should be fine. Please check it out to follow.\nBoth ProjectFoo and ProjectBar share the code in the common submodule. \nProjectFooBarCommoneSubmodule:master is 6850e4e4c1fac49de398\nIn ProjectFoo: \ngit submodule status\n\n-6850e4e4c1fac49de39890703f21486ca04b87a0 common\nIn ProjectBar:\ngit submodule status\n\n-6850e4e4c1fac49de39890703f21486ca04b87a0 common\nSo both point to the same revision, right? The trick here is to see, that ProjectFoo and ProjectBar point to the revision (6850e4e4c1fac49de39890703f21486ca04b87a0) not the branch (master), although they are the same thing. The first one is a detached head, and the other a named branch.\nIf you want to do some fixing on ProjectFooBarCommoneSubmodule, you can go to the subdir in e.g. ProjectFoo, and choose the branch instead of the revision:\ngit checkout master \n<Do your coding and pushing here>\n\nThen go one directory up, and check git submodule status. It should tell you, that you are now out of sync. E.g\ngit submodule status\n\n+e24bd2bf45d52171a63b67ac05cd4be0ac965f60 common (heads/master-1-ge24bd2b)\nNow you can do a git add, to set the reference to this particular commit(ge24bd...), do a commit, and after this the submodule reference points to this revision, which also happens to be master on ProjectFooBarCommoneSubmodule. \nNow you need to update the reference in ProjectBar as well. Go to ProjectBar/common, and do git fetch origin (this is a fast forward merge), do \ngit checkout master \ncd ..\ngit add common\ngit commit -m \"Bumped up the revision\"\ngit push origin master # to publish the revision bump to everybody else\n\nSo, as with any git repository, you don't need to work on a detached head. You can either work on master, or create a named branch. Either way, make sure that upstream contains the ProjectFooBarCommoneSubmodule changes, or you will break both ProjectFoo and ProjectBar, if they reference something that doesn't exist.

It could be in the file .git/objects/c2/6cf8af130955c5c67cfea96f9532680b963628. Note that the first two characters, c2, make up a directory and the rest is the filename. Since many filesystems don't perform well when there's too many files in one directory, this prevents any one directory from having too many files in it and keeps this little directory database efficient.\nWith just the short hash, c26cf8a, git can do the equivalent of .git/objects/c2/6cf8a* and that's likely to be a single file. Since the objects are subdivided into subdirectories, there's not too many filenames to look through to check if there's more than one match.\nc26cf8a alone contains enough possibilities, 16^7 or 2^28 or 268,435,456 that it's very unlikely another commit will share that prefix.\nBasically, Git uses the filesystem itself as a simple key/value store, and it can look up partial keys without having to scan the whole list of keys.\n\nThat's one way to store objects. More and more, Git stores its objects in packfiles. It's a very efficient way to store just the changes between files. From time to time, your Git repository will examine what's in .git/objects and store just the differences in .git/objects/pack/pack-<checksum>.\nThat's a binary format, I'm not going to get into it here, and I don't understand it myself anyway. :)"}]}

So I was trying the solution that is add an extra .gitkeep file under the directory so that it won't be empty. When I was trying that solution, if in the .gitignore file, I write like below:\nwww\n!*.gitkeep\n\nIt doesn't work(My intention is to ignore all contents under www but keep the directory).

But for www/*, git checks all files/folders inside www, and ignores all of them with the pattern *. It seems to lead to the same results since git won't track an empty folder www if all its child files/folders are ignored. And indeed the results will be no difference for OP's case with www/ or www/* standalone. But it does make differences if it's combined with other rules. \nFor example, what if we want to only include www/1.txt but ignore all others inside www?\nThe following .gitignore won't work.\nwww/\n!www/1.txt\n\nWhile the following .gitignore works, why?\nwww/*\n!www/1.txt\n\nFor the former, git just ignores the directory www, and won't even look inside to include www/1.txt again. The first rule excludes the parent directory www but not www/1.txt, and as a result www/1.txt cannot be \"included again\". \nBut for the latter, git first ignores all files/folers under www, and then includes one of them again which is www/1.txt.\nFor this example, the follwing lines in the documentation may help:\n\nAn optional prefix \"!\" which negates the pattern; any matching file\n  excluded by a previous pattern will become included again.

Pull also now has recursion options that make it more useful with submodules.  This answer ignores the submodules.]\nThe git pull script is meant as a convenience method for invoking git fetch followed by git merge (or, with git pull --rebase, invoking git fetch followed by git rebase).\nThe first extra argument to git pull tells it which remote to give to the fetch operation:\ngit pull origin\n\nfor example, means to fetch from origin.  If you leave this out, Git uses the current branch's remote:\n$ git branch\n* master\n$ git config --get branch.master.remote\norigin\n\nThe second (and any additional) arguments to git pull tell it which branch or branches to merge in.  These are the names of the branches as found on the remote.  For instance, suppose you create a new branch feature2 that tracks origin/feature:\n$ git checkout -b feature2 origin/feature\n\nIf you now want to fetch from origin to pick up new commits added to their feature branch, but merge them in to your local feature2 branch:\n$ git pull origin feature\n\nIf you leave out the branch name(s), git uses the current branch's merge:\n$ git config --get branch.feature2.merge\nfeature\n\nNote that if you list multiple branch names, Git will do an \"octopus merge\".

Use the following to add two pushurls to your origin:\ngit remote set-url --add --push origin git://original/repo.git\ngit remote set-url --add --push origin git://another/repo.git\n\nSo when you push to origin, it will push to both repositories.\nUPDATE 1: Git 1.8.0.1 and 1.8.1 (and possibly other versions) seem to have a bug that causes --add to replace the original URL the first time you use it, so you need to re-add the original URL using the same command. Doing git remote -v should reveal the current URLs for each remote.\nUPDATE 2: Junio C. Hamano, the Git maintainer, explained it's how it was designed. Doing git remote set-url --add --push <remote_name> <url> adds a pushurl for a given remote, which overrides the default URL for pushes. However, you may add multiple pushurls for a given remote, which then allows you to push to multiple remotes using a single git push. You can verify this behavior below:\n$ git clone git://original/repo.git\n$ git remote -v\norigin  git://original/repo.git (fetch)\norigin  git://original/repo.git (push)\n$ git config -l | grep '^remote\\.'\nremote.origin.url=git://original/repo.git\nremote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*\n\nNow, if you want to push to two or more repositories using a single command, you may create a new remote named all (as suggested by @Adam Nelson in comments), or keep using the origin, though the latter name is less descriptive for this purpose. If you still want to use origin, skip the following step, and use origin instead of all in all other steps.\nSo let's add a new remote called all that we'll reference later when pushing to multiple repositories:\n$ git remote add all git://original/repo.git\n$ git remote -v\nall git://original/repo.git (fetch)               <-- ADDED\nall git://original/repo.git (push)                <-- ADDED\norigin  git://original/repo.git (fetch)\norigin  git://original/repo.git (push)\n$ git config -l | grep '^remote\\.all'\nremote.all.url=git://original/repo.git            <-- ADDED\nremote.all.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/all/* <-- ADDED\n\nThen let's add a pushurl to the all remote, pointing to another repository:\n$ git remote set-url --add --push all git://another/repo.git\n$ git remote -v\nall git://original/repo.git (fetch)\nall git://another/repo.git (push)                 <-- CHANGED\norigin  git://original/repo.git (fetch)\norigin  git://original/repo.git (push)\n$ git config -l | grep '^remote\\.all'\nremote.all.url=git://original/repo.git\nremote.all.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/all/*\nremote.all.pushurl=git://another/repo.git         <-- ADDED\n\nHere git remote -v shows the new pushurl for push, so if you do git push all master, it will push the master branch to git://another/repo.git only. This shows how pushurl overrides the default url (remote.all.url).\nNow let's add another pushurl pointing to the original repository:\n$ git remote set-url --add --push all git://original/repo.git\n$ git remote -v\nall git://original/repo.git (fetch)\nall git://another/repo.git (push)\nall git://original/repo.git (push)                <-- ADDED\norigin  git://original/repo.git (fetch)\norigin  git://original/repo.git (push)\n$ git config -l | grep '^remote\\.all'\nremote.all.url=git://original/repo.git\nremote.all.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/all/*\nremote.all.pushurl=git://another/repo.git\nremote.all.pushurl=git://original/repo.git        <-- ADDED\n\nYou see both pushurls we added are kept. Now a single git push all master will push the master branch to both git://another/repo.git and git://original/repo.git.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: If your remotes have distinct rules (hooks) to accept/reject a push, one remote may accept it while the other doesn't. Therefore, if you want them to have the exact same history, you'll need to fix your commits locally to make them acceptable by both remotes and push again, or you might end up in a situation where you can only fix it by rewriting history (using push -f), and that could cause problems for people that have already pulled your previous changes from the repo."}]}

That means some tags will have ^{} at the end of the refname. (For more information about that see this question elsewhere on StackOverflow.)\nFor human consumption this doesn't matter much, but if you don't want to see those ^{}'s add --refs.\nSorting\nIt is possible sort the list of references using --sort.\nThe sort option uses the same sort keys as git for-each-ref. As we don't have all of the information locally, not all of the options are available to us (for instance date related sort keys).\nWe want to use version sort, based on the reference name. To do so, we use the version:refname key. This can also be abbreviated to v:refname.\nThis will sort the versions ascending, meaning the latest version will be last.\nTo reverse the list prepend the sort key with -: --sort='-v:refname'.\nPre-release sorting\nAt this point, version-sort will place release candidates (for instance v2.28.0-rc2) after the stable version that they should come in front of.\nSince v2.12 we can use a configuration flag that tells Git to sort refnames with a specific character suffix after references without that character suffix: git -c 'versionsort.suffix=-'.\nTo always use versionsort.suffix like this, it can be set globally:\ngit config --global 'versionsort.suffix' '-'\n\nBetween v2.4 and v2.12 the flag is called versionsort.prereleaseSuffix.\nSorting in older versions of Git\nFor older Git versions a trick can be used: a dash character - is sorted before a space   but a tilde ~ is sorted after a space.\nSo by replacing the dash - with a tilde ~, things get sorted in the right order. This can be done using tr '-' '~'\nOne line only\nAs we don't really care for all of the output, other than the last line, we only show the tail: tail --lines=1. Of course, if the list is retrieved in descending order (with --sort='-v:refname'), this would be: head --lines=1.\nJust the Refname\nThe output from the ls-remote command also outputs the reference hash:\nada126bd28d66c8c8ff5966a52d63ce2c9e4d031        refs/tags/v2.28.0-rc0\n\nTo only see the actual tag (i.e. the reference name), we can cut of the first part of the line: cut --delimiter='/' --fields=3\nReference filter\nThe last thing to note is that ls-remote can be given a filter to only show reference that match the filter pattern. For instance, for Semantic Versioning we could use: '*.*.*'. Anything that does not match that pattern will not be shown.\nIf the repository always prefixes a version tag with a v, it could be narrowed down further to 'v*.*.*'.\nAnother example is to only retrieve the latest tag for a specific main version. For instance, to only see tags for verion 2 of a repo, we could use 'v2.*'.\nMake sure to use quotes around the filter, otherwise that star * will cause you trouble!\nReference not found\nWhen using a filter it is a good idea to use the --exit-code flag.\nThis is because Git will always exit with status code 0 to indicate it successfully talked with the remote repository.\nFor human consumption this is fine, as you'll see on the screen if any refs have been found.\nIf this code is used in a shell script, however, that can be problematic.\nGit can be told to use status code 2 when no matching refs are found in the remote repository. This is done by using the --exit-code flag.\nThat way a script will know when something goes wrong!\nObviosuly, if no filter is used, using --exit-code does not really make sense.\nTime for an example!\nLets say we wanted to know what the latest tag of Git is.\nWe would do:\ngit ls-remote --sort='version:refname' --tags https://github.com/git/git.git\n\nThat would return a long list with all the tags in order, as shown below (truncated for sanity's sake).\n    ...\n\n4c8bcdda4d6e4757caf876ddc401b5392e874e21        refs/tags/v2.28.0\nada126bd28d66c8c8ff5966a52d63ce2c9e4d031        refs/tags/v2.28.0-rc0\nbd42bbe1a46c0fe486fc33e82969275e27e4dc19        refs/tags/v2.28.0-rc0^{}\n49bfe36405d1631a303992cac5cc408980a0454e        refs/tags/v2.28.0-rc1\n3ddac3d691c3633cd4d9a74c07e3b2301f546f77        refs/tags/v2.28.0-rc1^{}\n84a0d5cc2107b83a791aa4034cc54874e1d50668        refs/tags/v2.28.0-rc2\nb066807397fd55553f4910ede74839e319b661fd        refs/tags/v2.28.0-rc2^{}\n47ae905ffb98cc4d4fd90083da6bc8dab55d9ecc        refs/tags/v2.28.0^{}\n\nThis tells us the latest tag is v2.28.0.\nAnother example would be to set versionsort.suffix globally and then get just the last tag:\ngit config --global 'versionsort.suffix' '-'\n\ngit ls-remote --refs --sort=':refname' --tags https://github.com/git/git.git \\\n    | tail --lines=1 | cut --delimiter='/' --fields=3\n\nNow, let's see if there is already a version 3 of Git!\n$ git ls-remote --exit-code --refs --tags https://github.com/git/git.git 'v3.*'\n$ echo $?\n2 # nope, not yet"}]}

It's not necessary that a push will update the updated_at attribute -- that will only happen if a push triggers an update to the repository object. For example, if the primary language of the repository was Python, and then you pushed lots of JavaScript code -- that might change the primary language to JavaScript, which updates the repository object's language attribute and in turn updates the updated_at attribute.

E.g., it doesn't munge timestamps to help threaded mail readers handled out-of-order\ndelivery.\nSubjectively, GGG seems to be more commonly used on the list these days, especially by list regulars.\nGGG seems to be under more active development (likely related to point 2).\n\nSo let's actually swap out submitGit for GGG.\nWhile we're there, let's put another link to the GGG page in the PR template, because that's where users who are learning about it for the first time will want to go.\nto read more.\n\n\nWith Git 2.25 (Q1 2020), there is a tutorial on object enumeration, which provides a good example on how to contribute/test/report a bug.\nSee commit e0479fa (11 Oct 2019) by Emily Shaffer (nasamuffin).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 15d9f3d, 10 Nov 2019)\n\ndocumentation: add tutorial for object walking\nSigned-off-by: Emily Shaffer\nHelped-by: Eric Sunshine\n\n\nExisting documentation on object walks seems to be primarily intended as a reference for those already familiar with the procedure.\nThis tutorial attempts to give an entry-level guide to a couple of bare-bones object walks so that new Git contributors can learn the concepts without having to wade through options parsing or special casing.\nThe target audience is a Git contributor who is just getting started with the concept of object walking.\nThe goal is to prepare this contributor to be able to understand and modify existing commands which perform revision walks more easily, although it will also prepare contributors to create new commands which perform walks.\nThe tutorial covers a basic overview of the structs involved during object walk, setting up a basic commit walk, setting up a basic all-object walk, and adding some configuration changes to both walk types.\nIt intentionally does not cover how to create new commands or search for options from the command line or gitconfigs.\nThere is an associated patchset at https://github.com/nasamuffin/git/tree/revwalk that contains a reference implementation of the code generated by this tutorial.\n\nNote: that tutorial has been amended in Git 2.27 (Q2 2020):\nSee commit e3f53ce (28 Mar 2020) by Johannes Schindelin (dscho).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 7780604, 22 Apr 2020)\n\nMyFirstObjectWalk: remove unnecessary conditional statement\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Schindelin\nReviewed-by: Emily Shaffer\n\n\nIn the given example, commit cannot be NULL (because this is the loop condition: if it was NULL, the loop body would not be entered at all).

Also mention some of the conventions in case folks are unfamiliar with IRC.\nBecause the mentoring list and #git-devel are both a subset of Git contributors, finally list the main Git list and mention some of the posting conventions.\n\nAnd:\n\nMyFirstContribution: rephrase contact info\nSigned-off-by: Emily Shaffer\nReviewed-by: Jonathan Nieder\n\n\nMake an effort not to discourage new users from mailing questions to [email\u00a0protected], and explain the purpose of the mentoring list in contrast to the main list.\n\n\nWith Git 2.27 (Q2 2020), before reporting a bug, read the (new) FAQ.\nSee commit 2149b67 (30 Mar 2020) by brian m. carlson (bk2204).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 06aaafb, 22 Apr 2020)\n\ndocs: add a FAQ\nSigned-off-by: brian m. carlson\n\n\nGit is an enormously flexible and powerful piece of software.\nHowever, it can be intimidating for many users and there are a set of common questions that users often ask.\nWhile we already have some new user documentation, it's worth adding a FAQ to address common questions that users often have.\nEven though some of this is addressed elsewhere in the documentation, experience has shown that it is difficult for users to find, so a centralized location is helpful.\nAdd such a FAQ and fill it with some common questions and answers. While there are few entries now, we can expand it in the future to cover more things as we find new questions that users have.\nThe FAQ also addresses common configuration questions that apply not only to Git as an independent piece of software but also the ecosystem of CI tools and hosting providers that people use, since these are the source of common questions.\n\n\nWith Git 2.27 (Q2 2020), you can use the \"bugreport\" tool.\nSee commit 8f0e984 (27 Apr 2020), and commit 69bcbbc, commit 1411914, commit 617d571, commit 238b439, commit 709df95 (16 Apr 2020) by Emily Shaffer (nasamuffin).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit dd094c2, 01 May 2020)\n\nbugreport: add tool to generate debugging info\nSigned-off-by: Emily Shaffer\n\n\nTeach Git how to prompt the user for a good bug report: reproduction steps, expected behavior, and actual behavior. Later, Git can learn how to collect some diagnostic information from the repository.\nIf users can send us a well-written bug report which contains diagnostic information we would otherwise need to ask the user for, we can reduce the number of question-and-answer round trips between the reporter and the Git contributor.\nUsers may also wish to send a report like this to their local \"Git expert\" if they have put their repository into a state they are confused by.\n\nThe git bugreport documentation includes:\n\ngit bugreport [(-o | --output-directory) <path>] [(-s | --suffix) <format>]\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nCaptures information about the user's machine, Git client, and repository state, as well as a form requesting information about the behavior the user observed, into a single text file which the user can then share, for example to the Git mailing list, in order to report an observed bug.\nThe following information is requested from the user:\n\nReproduction steps\nExpected behavior\nActual behavior\n\n\n\nWith Git 2.27 (Q2 2020), \"git bugreport\" learned to report enabled hooks in the repository.\nSee commit 788a776 (08 May 2020) by Emily Shaffer (nasamuffin).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 3583730, 14 May 2020)\n\nbugreport: collect list of populated hooks\nSigned-off-by: Emily Shaffer\n\n\nOccasionally a failure a user is seeing may be related to a specific hook which is being run, perhaps without the user realizing.\nWhile the contents of hooks can be sensitive - containing user data or process information specific to the user's organization - simply knowing that a hook is being run at a certain stage can help us to understand whether something is going wrong.\nWithout a definitive list of hook names within the code, we compile our own list from the documentation. This is likely prone to bitrot, but designing a single source of truth for acceptable hooks is too much overhead for this small change to the bugreport tool.\n\n\nWith Git 2.28 (Q3 2020), \"git bugreport\" learns to report what shell is in use.\nSee commit 4a4804e, commit 39f4919 (12 May 2020) by Emily Shaffer (nasamuffin).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit ce095ec, 09 Jun 2020)\n\nhelp: add shell-path to --build-options\nSigned-off-by: Emily Shaffer\n\n\nIt may be useful to know which shell Git was built to try to point to, in the event that shell-based Git commands are failing.\n$SHELL_PATH is set during the build and used to launch the manpage viewer, as well as by git-compat-util.h, and it's used during tests.\n'git version --build-options' is encouraged for use in bug reports, so it makes sense to include this information there.\n\nAnd:\n\nbugreport: include user interactive shell\nSigned-off-by: Emily Shaffer\n\n\nIt's possible a user may complain about the way that Git interacts with their interactive shell, e.g. autocompletion or shell prompt. In that case, it's useful for us to know which shell they're using interactively.\n\n\nExpectation for the original contributor after responding to a review comment to use the explanation in a patch update has been described with Git 2.30 (Q1 2021).\nSee commit a6d8d11 (20 Nov 2020) by Junio C Hamano (gitster).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit b94b1f9, 30 Nov 2020)\n\nMyFirstContribition: answering questions is not the end of the story\nReviewed-by: Emily Shaffer\n\n\nA review exchange may begin with a reviewer asking \"what did you mean by this phrase in your log message (or here in the doc)?\", the author answering what was meant, and then the reviewer saying \"ah, that is what you meant---then the flow of the logic makes sense\".\nBut that is not the happy end of the story.\nNew contributors often forget that the material that has been reviewed in the above exchange is still unclear in the same way to the next person who reads it, until it gets updated.\nWhile we are in the vicinity, rephrase the verb \"request\" used to refer to comments by reviewers to \"suggest\"---this matches the contrast between \"original\" and \"suggested\" that appears later in the same paragraph, and more importantly makes it clearer that it is not like authors are to please reviewers' wishes but rather reviewers are merely helping authors to polish their commits.\nmade the change suggested, feel the original is better, or that the comment\n\nMyFirstContribution now includes in its man page:\n\nReviewers may ask you about what you wrote in the patchset, either in\nthe proposed commit log message or in the changes themselves.  You\nshould answer these questions in your response messages, but often the\nreason why reviewers asked these questions to understand what you meant\nto write is because your patchset needed clarification to be understood.\nDo not be satisfied by just answering their questions in your response\nand hear them say that they now understand what you wanted to say.\nUpdate your patches to clarify the points reviewers had trouble with,\nand prepare your v2; the words you used to explain your v1 to answer\nreviewers' questions may be useful thing to use.  Your goal is to make\nyour v2 clear enough so that it becomes unnecessary for you to give the\nsame explanation to the next person who reads it.\n\n\nWith Git 2.30 (Q1 2021), the use of non-reentrant localtime() has been removed.\nSee commit 4f6460d (30 Nov 2020) by Taylor Blau (ttaylorr).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit bb48056, 08 Dec 2020)\n\nbuiltin/bugreport.c: use thread-safe localtime_r()\nSigned-off-by: Taylor Blau\n\n\nTo generate its filename, the 'git bugreport'(man) builtin asks the system for the current time with 'localtime()'.\nSince this uses a shared buffer, it is not thread-safe.\nEven though 'git bugreport'(man) is not multi-threaded, using localtime() can trigger some static analysis tools to complain, and a quick\n$ git grep -oh 'localtime\\(_.\\)\\?' -- **/*.c | sort | uniq -c  \n\nshows that the only usage of the thread-unsafe 'localtime' is in a piece of documentation.\nSo, convert this instance to use the thread-safe version for consistency, and to appease some analysis tools."}]}

This has a single parent, which is the commit Q:\nP--Q--R (master)\n\nAfter successfully pushing, the commit graph for the GitHub repository looks the same.\nUserB started with the same history:\nP--Q (master)\n\n... but created a different commit, say called S, which has his modified version of FileB:\nP--Q--S (master)\n\nUserB tries to push that to GitHub, but the push is refused - unless you \"force\" the push, you're not allowed to update a remote branch unless the version you're pushing includes all of the history in that remote branch.  So, UserB pulls from GitHub.  A pull really consists of two steps, fetching and merging.

However, in the case of a commit such as M, with more than one parent, it has to choose a parent to show the diff against.  That explains why the diff shown for the merge commit M might appear to be the same as that shown for one of S or R.

(The pro git book refers to this as two refspecs; which is probably technically more correct. However, you just about always have the ability to list multiple refspecs if you need to, so in day to day life it likely makes little difference.)\nThe first pattern, then, is +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* which has three parts:\n\nThe + means to apply the rule without failure even if doing so would move a target ref in a non-fast-forward manner.  I'll come back to that.\nThe part before the : (but after the + if there is one) is the \"source\" pattern.  That's refs/heads/*, meaning this rule applies to any remote reference under refs/heads (meaning, branches).\nThe part after the : is the \"destination\" pattern. That's refs/remotes/origin/*.\n\nSo if the origin has a branch master, represented as refs/heads/master, this will create a remote branch reference origin/master represented as refs/remotes/origin/master.  And so on for any branch name (*).\nSo back to that +... suppose the origin has\nA --- B <--(master)\n\nYou fetch and, applying that refspec you get\nA --- B <--(origin/master)\n\n(If you applied typical tracking rules and did a pull you also have master pointed at B.)  \nA --- B <--(origin/master)(master)\n\nNow some things happen on the remote.  Someone maybe did a reset that erased B, then committed C, then forced a push.  So the remote says\nA --- C <--(master)\n\nWhen you fetch, you get\nA --- B\n \\\n  C\n\nand git must decide whether to allow the move of origin/master from B to C.  By default it wouldn't allow this because it's not a fast-forward (it would tell you it rejected the pull for that ref), but because the rule starts with + it will accept it.  \nA --- B <--(master)\n \\\n  C <--(origin/master)\n\n(A pull will in this case result in a merge commit.)\nThe second pattern is similar, but for merge-requests refs (which I assume is related to your server's implementation of PR's; I'm not familiar with it).\nMore about refspecs:  https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-The-Refspec"}]}

The author basically tells you how to avoid duplicated commits:\n\nDo not rebase commits that you have pushed to a public repository.\n\nI am going to tell you my particular situation because I think it does not exactly fit the Pro Git scenario and I still end up with duplicated commits.\nLet's say I have two remote branches with their local counterparts:\norigin/master    origin/dev\n|                |\nmaster           dev\n\nAll four branches contains the same commits and I am going to start development in dev:\norigin/master : C1 C2 C3 C4\nmaster        : C1 C2 C3 C4\n\norigin/dev    : C1 C2 C3 C4\ndev           : C1 C2 C3 C4\n\nAfter a couple of commits I push the changes to origin/dev:\norigin/master : C1 C2 C3 C4\nmaster        : C1 C2 C3 C4\n\norigin/dev    : C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6  # (2) git push\ndev           : C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6  # (1) git checkout dev, git commit\n\nI have to go back to master to make a quick fix:\norigin/master : C1 C2 C3 C4 C7  # (2) git push\nmaster        : C1 C2 C3 C4 C7  # (1) git checkout master, git commit\n\norigin/dev    : C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6\ndev           : C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6\n\nAnd back to dev I rebase the changes to include the quick fix in my actual development:\norigin/master : C1 C2 C3 C4 C7\nmaster        : C1 C2 C3 C4 C7\n\norigin/dev    : C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6\ndev           : C1 C2 C3 C4 C7 C5' C6'  # git checkout dev, git rebase master\n\nIf I display the history of commits with GitX/gitk I notice that origin/dev now contains two identical commits C5' and C6' which are different to Git. Now if I push the changes to origin/dev this is the result:\norigin/master : C1 C2 C3 C4 C7\nmaster        : C1 C2 C3 C4 C7\n\norigin/dev    : C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C5' C6'  # git push\ndev           : C1 C2 C3 C4 C7 C5' C6'\n\nMaybe I don't fully understand the explanation in Pro Git, so I would like to know two things:\n\nWhy does Git duplicate these commits while rebasing? Is there a particular reason to do that instead of just applying C5 and C6 after C7?\nHow can I avoid that? Would it be wise to do it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Short answer\nYou omitted the fact that you ran git push, got the following error, and then proceeded to run git pull:\nTo [email\u00a0protected]:username/test1.git\n !

Integrate the remote changes (e.g.\nhint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\nhint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\n\nDespite Git trying to be helpful, its 'git pull' advice is most likely not what you want to do.\nIf you are:\n\nWorking on a \"feature branch\" or \"developer branch\" alone, then you can run git push --force to update the remote with your post-rebase commits (as per user4405677's answer).\nWorking on a branch with multiple developers at the same time, then you probably should not be using git rebase in the first place. To update dev with changes from master, you should, instead of running git rebase master dev, run git merge master whilst on dev (as per Justin's answer).\n\nA slightly longer explanation\nEach commit hash in Git is based on a number of factors, one of which is the hash of the commit that comes before it.\nIf you reorder commits you will change commit hashes; rebasing (when it does something) will change commit hashes. With that, the result of running git rebase master dev, where dev is out of sync with master, will create new commits (and thus hashes) with the same content as those on dev but with the commits on master inserted before them.\nYou can end up in a situation like this in multiple ways. Two ways I can think of:\n\nYou could have commits on master that you want to base your dev work on\nYou could have commits on dev that have already been pushed to a remote, which you then proceed to change (reword commit messages, reorder commits, squash commits, etc.)\n\nLet's better understand what happened\u2014here is an example:\nYou have a repository:\n2a2e220 (HEAD, master) C5\nab1bda4 C4\n3cb46a9 C3\n85f59ab C2\n4516164 C1\n0e783a3 C0\n\n\nYou then proceed to change commits.\ngit rebase --interactive HEAD~3 # Three commits before where HEAD is pointing\n\n(This is where you'll have to take my word for it: there are a number of ways to change commits in Git. In this example I changed the time of C3, but you be inserting new commits, changing commit messages, reordering commits, squashing commits together, etc.)\nba7688a (HEAD, master) C5\n44085d5 C4\n961390d C3\n85f59ab C2\n4516164 C1\n0e783a3 C0\n\n\nThis is where it is important to notice that the commit hashes are different. This is expected behaviour since you have changed something (anything) about them. This is okay, BUT:\n\nTrying to push will show you an error (and hint that you should run git pull).\n$ git push origin master\nTo [email\u00a0protected]:username/test1.git\n ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)\nerror: failed to push some refs to '[email\u00a0protected]:username/test1.git'\nhint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind\nhint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.\nhint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\nhint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\n\nIf we run git pull, we see this log:\n7df65f2 (HEAD, master) Merge branch 'master' of bitbucket.org:username/test1\nba7688a C5\n44085d5 C4\n961390d C3\n2a2e220 (origin/master) C5\n85f59ab C2\nab1bda4 C4\n4516164 C1\n3cb46a9 C3\n0e783a3 C0\n\nOr, shown another way:\n\nAnd now we have duplicate commits locally. If we were to run git push we would send them up to the server.\nTo avoid getting to this stage, we could have run git push --force (where we instead ran git pull). This would have sent our commits with the new hashes to the server without issue. To fix the issue at this stage, we can reset back to before we ran git pull:\nLook at the reflog (git reflog) to see what the commit hash was before we ran git pull.\n070e71d HEAD@{1}: pull: Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.\nba7688a HEAD@{2}: rebase -i (finish): returning to refs/heads/master\nba7688a HEAD@{3}: rebase -i (pick): C5\n44085d5 HEAD@{4}: rebase -i (pick): C4\n961390d HEAD@{5}: commit (amend): C3\n3cb46a9 HEAD@{6}: cherry-pick: fast-forward\n85f59ab HEAD@{7}: rebase -i (start): checkout HEAD~~~\n2a2e220 HEAD@{8}: rebase -i (finish): returning to refs/heads/master\n2a2e220 HEAD@{9}: rebase -i (start): checkout refs/remotes/origin/master\n2a2e220 HEAD@{10}: commit: C5\nab1bda4 HEAD@{11}: commit: C4\n3cb46a9 HEAD@{12}: commit: C3\n85f59ab HEAD@{13}: commit: C2\n4516164 HEAD@{14}: commit: C1\n0e783a3 HEAD@{15}: commit (initial): C0\n\nAbove we see that ba7688a was the commit we were at before running git pull. With that commit hash in hand we can reset back to that (git reset --hard ba7688a) and then run git push --force.\nAnd we're done.\nBut wait, I continued to base work off of the duplicated commits\nIf you somehow didn't notice that the commits were duplicated and proceeded to continue working atop of duplicate commits, you've really made a mess for yourself. The size of the mess is proportional to the number of commits you have atop of the duplicates.\nWhat this looks like:\n3b959b4 (HEAD, master) C10\n8f84379 C9\n0110e93 C8\n6c4a525 C7\n630e7b4 C6\n070e71d (origin/master) Merge branch 'master' of bitbucket.org:username/test1\nba7688a C5\n44085d5 C4\n961390d C3\n2a2e220 C5\n85f59ab C2\nab1bda4 C4\n4516164 C1\n3cb46a9 C3\n0e783a3 C0\n\n\nOr, shown another way:\n\nIn this scenario we want to remove the duplicate commits, but keep the commits that we have based on them\u2014we want to keep C6 through C10. As with most things, there are a number of ways to go about this:\nEither:\n\nCreate a new branch at the last duplicated commit1, cherry-pick each commit (C6 through C10 inclusive) onto that new branch, and treat that new branch as canonical.\nOr run git rebase --interactive $commit, where $commit is the commit prior to both the duplicated commits2. Here we can outright delete the lines for the duplicates.\n\n1 It doesn't matter which of the two you choose, either ba7688a or 2a2e220 work fine.\n2 In the example it would be 85f59ab.\nTL;DR\nSet advice.pushNonFastForward to false:\ngit config --global advice.pushNonFastForward false"}]}

If you make a local commit and then run git pull after someone else pushes a commit up to the repository, Git downloads the other developer's commit and then merges it into your local branch.\nHow to avoid these merge commits in the future\nYou could use git pull --rebase to prevent this from happening in the future, but rebasing has its perils, and I recommend avoiding pull altogether.\nInstead, I encourage you to follow this usage pattern:\n# download the latest commits\ngit remote update -p\n\n# update the local branch\ngit merge --ff-only @{u}\n\n# if the above fails with a complaint that the local branch has\n# diverged:\ngit rebase -p @{u}\n\nExplanation\n\ngit remote update -p downloads all of the commits in the remote repositories and updates the remote tracking branches (e.g., origin/master).  It does NOT touch your working directory, index, or local branches.\nThe -p argument prunes deleted upstream branches.  Thus, if the foo branch is deleted in the origin repository, git remote update -p will automatically delete your origin/foo ref.\ngit merge --ff-only @{u} tells Git to merge the upstream branch (the @{u} argument) into your local branch but only if your local branch can be \"fast forwarded\" to the upstream branch (in other words, if it hasn't diverged).\ngit rebase -p @{u} effectively moves the commits you've made but haven't yet pushed on top of the upstream branch, which eliminates the need to create the silly merge commits you're trying to avoid.  This improves the linearity of the development history, making it easier to review.\nThe -p option tells Git to preserve merges.  This prevents Git from linearizing the commits being rebased.  This is important if, for example, you merged a feature branch into master.  Without -p, every commit on the feature branch would be duplicated on master as part of the linearization done by git rebase.  This would make the development history harder to review, not easier.\nBeware:  git rebase might not do what you expect it to do, so review the results before pushing.  For example:\ngit log --graph --oneline --decorate --date-order --color --boundary @{u}..\n\n\nI prefer this approach over git pull --rebase for the following reasons:\n\nIt allows you to see the incoming upstream commits before your modify your history to incorporate them.\nIt allows you to pass the -p (--preserve-merges) option to git rebase in case you need to rebase an intentional merge (e.g., merge of an already-pushed feature branch into master).\n\nShorthand:  git up instead of git pull\nTo make it easy to do the above, I recommend creating an alias called up:\ngit config --global alias.up '!git remote update -p; git merge --ff-only @{u}'\n\nNow all you need to do to bring your branch up to date is to run:\ngit up\n\ninstead of git pull.  If you get an error because your local branch has diverged from the upstream branch, that's your cue to rebase.\nWhy not git pull --rebase?\nRunning git pull --rebase is equivalent to running git fetch followed by git rebase.  This attempts to fast-forward to the new upstream commits, but if that's not possible then it will rebase your local commits onto the new upstream commits.  This is usually OK, but be careful:\n\nRebase is an advanced topic, and you should understand the implications before rebasing.\ngit pull --rebase does not give you an opportunity to examine the commits before incorporating them.  Depending on what changed upstream, it's quite possible that rebase is the wrong operation\u2014a rebase --onto, merge, reset, or push -f might be more appropriate than a plain rebase.\nIt is not (currently) possible to pass --preserve-merges to the rebase operation, so any intentional merge of a feature branch will be linearized, replaying (and thus duplicating) all of the feature branch commits.\n\n\"Fixing\" an existing merge commit created by git pull\nIf you haven't yet pushed a merge commit created by git pull, you can rebase out the merge commit.  Assuming you haven't made any intentional merges (e.g., merging an already-pushed feature branch into your current branch), the following should do it:\ngit rebase @{u}\n\nThe above command tells Git to select all of the non-merge commits reachable from HEAD (the current commit), minus all the commits reachable from @{u} (which is shorthand for \"the upstream branch\", i.e., origin/master if HEAD is master), replay (cherry-pick) them on top of the upstream branch, and then move the current branch reference to point to the result of replaying the commits.  This effectively moves the non-merge commits onto the most recent upstream commit, which eliminates the merge created by git pull.\nIf you have an intentional merge commit, you don't want to run git rebase @{u} because it will replay everything from the other branch.  Dealing with this case is substantially more complicated, which is why it's good to use git up and avoid git pull altogether.  You'll probably have to use reset to undo the merge created by pull and then do git rebase -p @{u}.  The -p argument to git rebase hasn't worked reliably for me, so you might end up having to use reset to undo the intentional merge, update your local branch to @{u}, and then redo the intentional merge (which is a pain if there were a lot of hairy merge conflicts)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why does git-rebase give me merge conflicts when all I'm doing is squashing commits?\nWe have a Git repository with over 400 commits, the first couple dozen of which were a lot of trial-and-error. We want to clean up these commits by squashing many down into a single commit. Naturally, git-rebase seems the way to go. My problem is that it ends up with merge conflicts, and these conflicts are not easy to resolve. I don't understand why there should be any conflicts at all, since I'm just squashing commits (not deleting or rearranging). Very likely, this demonstrates that I'm not completely understanding how git-rebase does its squashes.\nHere's a modified version of the scripts I'm using:\n\nrepo_squash.sh (this is the script that is actually run):\n\nrm -rf repo_squash\ngit clone repo repo_squash\ncd repo_squash/\nGIT_EDITOR=../repo_squash_helper.sh git rebase --strategy theirs -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287a\n\n\nrepo_squash_helper.sh (this script is used only by repo_squash.sh):\n\nif grep -q \"pick \" $1\nthen\n#  cp $1 ../repo_squash_history.txt\n#  emacs -nw $1\n  sed -f ../repo_squash_list.txt < $1 > $1.tmp\n  mv $1.tmp $1\nelse\n  if grep -q \"initial import\" $1\n  then\n    cp ../repo_squash_new_message1.txt $1\n  elif grep -q \"fixing bad import\" $1\n  then\n    cp ../repo_squash_new_message2.txt $1\n  else\n    emacs -nw $1\n  fi\nfi\n\n\nrepo_squash_list.txt: (this file is used only by repo_squash_helper.sh)\n\n# Initial import\ns/pick \\(251a190\\)/squash \\1/g\n# Leaving \"Needed subdir\" for now\n# Fixing bad import\ns/pick \\(46c41d1\\)/squash \\1/g\ns/pick \\(5d7agf2\\)/squash \\1/g\ns/pick \\(3da63ed\\)/squash \\1/g\n\n\nI'll leave the \"new message\" contents to your imagination. Initially, I did this without the \"--strategy theirs\" option (i.e., using the default strategy, which if I understand the documentation correctly is recursive, but I'm not sure which recursive strategy is used), and it also didn't work. Also, I should point out that, using the commented out code in repo_squash_helper.sh, I saved off the original file that the sed script works on and ran the sed script against it to make sure it was doing what I wanted it to do (it was). Again, I don't even know why there would be a conflict, so it wouldn't seem to matter so much which strategy is used. Any advice or insight would be helpful, but mostly I just want to get this squashing working.\nUpdated with extra information from discussion with Jefromi:\nBefore working on our massive \"real\" repository, I used similar scripts on a test repository. It was a very simple repository and the test worked cleanly.\nThe message I get when it fails is:\nFinished one cherry-pick.\n# Not currently on any branch.\nnothing to commit (working directory clean)\nCould not apply 66c45e2... Needed subdir\n\nThis is the first pick after the first squash commit. Running git status yields a clean working directory. If I then do a git rebase --continue, I get a very similar message after a few more commits. If I then do it again, I get another very similar message after a couple dozen commits. If I do it yet again, this time it goes through about a hundred commits, and yields this message:\nAutomatic cherry-pick failed.  After resolving the conflicts,\nmark the corrected paths with 'git add <paths>', and\nrun 'git rebase --continue'\nCould not apply f1de3bc... Incremental\n\nIf I then run git status, I get:\n# Not currently on any branch.\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\n#\n# modified:   repo/file_A.cpp\n# modified:   repo/file_B.cpp\n#\n# Unmerged paths:\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\n#   (use \"git add/rm <file>...\" as appropriate to mark resolution)\n#\n# both modified:      repo/file_X.cpp\n#\n# Changed but not updated:\n#   (use \"git add/rm <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n#   (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n#\n# deleted:    repo/file_Z.imp\n\nThe \"both modified\" bit sounds weird to me, since this was just the result of a pick. It's also worth noting that if I look at the \"conflict\", it boils down to a single line with one version beginning it with a [tab] character, and the other one with four spaces. This sounded like it might be an issue with how I've set up my config file, but there's nothing of the sort in it. (I did note that core.ignorecase is set to true, but evidently git-clone did that automatically. I'm not completely surprised by that considering that the original source was on a Windows machine.)\nIf I manually fix file_X.cpp, it then fails shortly afterward with another conflict, this time between a file (CMakeLists.txt) that one version thinks should exist and one version thinks shouldn't. If I fix this conflict by saying I do want this file (which I do), a few commits later I get another conflict (in this same file) where now there's some rather non-trivial changes. It's still only about 25% of the way through the conflicts.\nI should also point out, since this might be very important, that this project started out in an svn repository. That initial history very likely was imported from that svn repository.\nUpdate #2:\nOn a lark (influenced by Jefromi's comments), I decided to do the change my repo_squash.sh to be:\nrm -rf repo_squash\ngit clone repo repo_squash\ncd repo_squash/\ngit rebase --strategy theirs -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287a\n\nAnd then, I just accepted the original entries, as is. I.e., the \"rebase\" shouldn't have changed a thing. It ended up with the same results describe previously.\nUpdate #3:\nAlternatively, if I omit the strategy and replace the last command with:\ngit rebase -i bd6a09a484b8230d0810e6689cf08a24f26f287a\n\nI no longer get the \"nothing to commit\" rebase problems, but I'm still left with the other conflicts.\nUpdate with toy repository that recreates problem:\ntest_squash.sh (this is the file you actually run):\n#========================================================\n# Initialize directories\n#========================================================\nrm -rf test_squash/ test_squash_clone/\nmkdir -p test_squash\nmkdir -p test_squash_clone\n#========================================================\n\n#========================================================\n# Create repository with history\n#========================================================\ncd test_squash/\ngit init\necho \"README\">README\ngit add README\ngit commit -m\"Initial commit: can't easily access for rebasing\"\necho \"Line 1\">test_file.txt\ngit add test_file.txt\ngit commit -m\"Created single line file\"\necho \"Line 2\">>test_file.txt \ngit add test_file.txt \ngit commit -m\"Meant for it to be two lines\"\ngit checkout -b dev\necho Meaningful code>new_file.txt\ngit add new_file.txt \ngit commit -m\"Meaningful commit\"\ngit checkout master\necho Conflicting meaningful code>new_file.txt\ngit add new_file.txt \ngit commit -m\"Conflicting meaningful commit\"\n# This will conflict\ngit merge dev\n# Fixes conflict\necho Merged meaningful code>new_file.txt\ngit add new_file.txt\ngit commit -m\"Merged dev with master\"\ncd ..\n\n#========================================================\n# Save off a clone of the repository prior to squashing\n#========================================================\ngit clone test_squash test_squash_clone\n#========================================================\n\n#========================================================\n# Do the squash\n#========================================================\ncd test_squash\nGIT_EDITOR=../test_squash_helper.sh git rebase -i HEAD@{7}\n#========================================================\n\n#========================================================\n# Show the results\n#========================================================\ngit log\ngit gc\ngit reflog\n#========================================================\n\ntest_squash_helper.sh (used by test_sqash.sh):\n# If the file has the phrase \"pick \" in it, assume it's the log file\nif grep -q \"pick \" $1\nthen\n  sed -e \"s/pick \\(.*\\) \\(Meant for it to be two lines\\)/squash \\1 \\2/g\" < $1 > $1.tmp\n  mv $1.tmp $1\n# Else, assume it's the commit message file\nelse\n# Use our pre-canned message\n  echo \"Created two line file\" > $1\nfi\n\nP.S.: Yes, I know some of you cringe when you see me using emacs as a fall-back editor.\nP.P.S.: We do know we'll have to blow away all of our clones of the existing repository after the rebase.

Is there a way to get detached heads to appear in this graph?\nI know that git reflog exists, but that is pretty hard to read since there is no structure - all you have to go on is the commit message, which still may be WIP if I haven't finished the commit yet.\nSome background (this is not necessary to answer the question, but will help explain the motivation for it): I'm a Mercurial user and my workflow involves a lot of anonymous branching. I tend to make use of hg heads a lot to check out these heads, and often hg rebase to separate or combine series of commits based on what makes sense for the purpose of an easy to understand code review.\nWhile I'm getting used to using git I often find myself with detached heads when, for example, I rebase some commits from a branch to make a new branch. Finding these detached heads is annoying with git reflog, and to be honest it's a little scary that they just disappear from the usual git log. I've even forgotten about old commits this way, and have had to dig them out of git reflog a day or two later. In Mercurial those commits would remain as an anonymous head, and I would be reminded that I need to finish them off."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It sounds like you're trying to use a workflow that doesn't quite match the way git works.\nFirst of all, a \"detached head\" in git isn't the same as Mercurial's concept of a \"head\". Git has exactly one HEAD, which is just the currently checked-out commit. \"Detached\" just means that you don't currently have a branch checked out. So when you create a commit, it won't be associated with a branch, and it'll be lost when you checkout a different commit.\nIn Git, every commit that you care about should be reachable from some branch. There's no such thing as an \"anonymous branch\", which is why git warns you when committing on a detached head. Committing on a detached head is like allocating an object and then throwing away the pointer; it's possible, but almost never what you want to do. Remember, branches in git are lightweight and can be ephemeral. Just create a branch before committing so that you can find your commits again.\nAll that being said, if you really want to see the structure of your repository, including commits that are only referenced from reflogs, you can use:\ngit log --graph --decorate $(git rev-list -g --all)"}]}

There are\nmany configuration options available to speed this up by either\navoiding the work or making use of cached results from previous\nGit commands. There is no single optimum set of settings right\nfor everyone. We\u2019ll list a summary of the relevant options to help\nyou, but before going into the list, you may want to run git status again, because your configuration may already be caching git status results, so it could be faster on subsequent runs. The --untracked-files=no flag or the status.showUntrackedFiles=no config (see above for both):\nindicate that git status should not report untracked\nfiles. This is the fastest option. git status will not list\nthe untracked files, so you need to be careful to remember if\nyou create any new files and manually git add them. advice.statusUoption=false (see git-config ):\nsetting this variable to false disables the warning message\ngiven when enumerating untracked files takes more than 2\nseconds.  In a large project, it may take longer and the user\nmay have already accepted the trade off (e.g. using \"-uno\" may\nnot be an acceptable option for the user), in which case, there\nis no point issuing the warning message, and in such a case,\ndisabling the warning may be the best. core.untrackedCache=true (see git-update-index ):\nenable the untracked cache feature and only search directories\nthat have been modified since the previous git status command.\nGit remembers the set of untracked files within each directory\nand assumes that if a directory has not been modified, then\nthe set of untracked files within has not changed.  This is much\nfaster than enumerating the contents of every directory, but still\nnot without cost, because Git still has to search for the set of\nmodified directories. The untracked cache is stored in the .git/index file. The reduced cost of searching for untracked\nfiles is offset slightly by the increased size of the index and\nthe cost of keeping it up-to-date. That reduced search time is\nusually worth the additional size. core.untrackedCache=true and core.fsmonitor=true or core.fsmonitor=<hook-command-pathname> (see git-update-index ): enable both the untracked cache\nand FSMonitor features and only search directories that have\nbeen modified since the previous git status command.  This\nis faster than using just the untracked cache alone because\nGit can also avoid searching for modified directories.  Git\nonly has to enumerate the exact set of directories that have\nchanged recently. While the FSMonitor feature can be enabled\nwithout the untracked cache, the benefits are greatly reduced\nin that case. Note that after you turn on the untracked cache and/or FSMonitor\nfeatures it may take a few git status commands for the various\ncaches to warm up before you see improved command times.

I'm just looking for data which makes it clear how to expect git to operate with each of the three settings.\n--\nUpdate 04/17/2012: After reading the article by Tim Clem linked by JJD in the comments, I have modified some of the values in the \"unknown\" values in the table above, as well as changing \"checkout existing | true to convert to CRLF instead of convert to client\".  Here are the definitions he gives, which are more clear than anything I've seen elsewhere:\ncore.autocrlf = false\n\nThis is the default, but most people are encouraged to change this\nimmediately. The result of using false is that Git doesn\u2019t ever mess\nwith line endings on your file. You can check in files with LF or CRLF\nor CR or some random mix of those three and Git does not care. This\ncan make diffs harder to read and merges more difficult. Most people\nworking in a Unix/Linux world use this value because they don\u2019t have\nCRLF problems and they don\u2019t need Git to be doing extra work whenever\nfiles are written to the object database or written out into the\nworking directory.\n\ncore.autocrlf = true\n\nThis means that Git will process all text files and make sure that\nCRLF is replaced with LF when writing that file to the object database\nand turn all LF back into CRLF when writing out into the working\ndirectory. This is the recommended setting on Windows because it\nensures that your repository can be used on other platforms while\nretaining CRLF in your working directory.\n\ncore.autocrlf = input\n\nThis means that Git will process all text files and make sure that\nCRLF is replaced with LF when writing that file to the object\ndatabase. It will not, however, do the reverse. When you read files\nback out of the object database and write them into the working\ndirectory they will still have LFs to denote the end of line. This\nsetting is generally used on Unix/Linux/OS X to prevent CRLFs from\ngetting written into the repository. The idea being that if you pasted\ncode from a web browser and accidentally got CRLFs into one of your\nfiles, Git would make sure they were replaced with LFs when you wrote\nto the object database.\n\nTim's article is excellent, the only thing I can think of that is missing is that he assumes the repository is in LF format, which is not necessarily true, especially for Windows only projects.\nComparing Tim's article to the highest voted answer to date by jmlane shows perfect agreement on the true and input settings and disagreement on the false setting."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best explanation of how core.autocrlf works is found on the gitattributes man page, in the text attribute section.\nThis is how core.autocrlf appears to work currently (or at least since v1.7.2 from what I am aware):\n\ncore.autocrlf = true\n\n\nText files checked-out from the repository that have only LF characters are normalized to CRLF in your working tree; files that contain CRLF in the repository will not be touched\nText files that have only LF characters in the repository, are normalized from CRLF to LF when committed back to the repository. Files that contain CRLF in the repository will be committed untouched.\n\n\ncore.autocrlf = input\n\n\nText files checked-out from the repository will keep original EOL characters in your working tree.\nText files in your working tree with CRLF characters are normalized to LF when committed back to the repository.\n\n\ncore.autocrlf = false\n\n\ncore.eol dictates EOL characters in the text files of your working tree.\ncore.eol = native by default, which means working tree EOLs will depend on where git is running: CRLF on a Windows machine, or LF in *nix.\nRepository gitattributes settings determines EOL character normalization for commits to the repository (default is normalization to LF characters).\n\nI've only just recently researched this issue and I also find the situation to be very convoluted. The core.eol setting definitely helped clarify how EOL characters are handled by git."}]}

In this case, if the file was previously committed, then you made the index to be different from the HEAD of the tree and the working copy, so that the HEAD now has the previously committed version of the file, the index has no file at all, and the working copy has the last modification of it.

First make sure that:\n\nYou really removed all variants of a filename, if a blob was moved over its lifetime. git log --name-only --follow --all -- filename can help you find renames.\nYou really filtered all refs: use --tag-name-filter cat -- --all when calling git filter-branch.\n\nThen there are two ways to get a smaller repository. A safer way is to clone, that keeps your original intact.\n\nClone it with git clone file:///path/to/repo. The clone will not have the removed objects. See git-clone. (Note that cloning with a plain path just hardlinks everything!)\n\nIf you really don\u2019t want to clone it, for whatever reasons, check the following points instead (in this order).

It\u2019s really only useful for\n  the case of \u201cI know I have a really bad pack, and I want to throw away\n  all the bad packing decisions I have done.\u201d\nTo explain this, it\u2019s worth explaining (you are probably aware of it, but\n  let me go through the basics anyway) how git delta-chains work, and how\n  they are so different from most other systems.\nIn other SCMs, a delta-chain is generally fixed. It might be \u201cforwards\u201d\n  or \u201cbackwards,\u201d and it might evolve a bit as you work with the repository,\n  but generally it\u2019s a chain of changes to a single file represented as some\n  kind of single SCM entity. In CVS, it\u2019s obviously the *,v file, and a lot\n  of other systems do rather similar things.\nGit also does delta-chains, but it does them a lot more \u201cloosely.\u201d There\n  is no fixed entity. Deltas are generated against any random other version\n  that git deems to be a good delta candidate (with various fairly\n  successful heuristics), and there are absolutely no hard grouping rules.\nThis is generally a very good thing. It\u2019s good for various conceptual\n  reasons (i.e., git internally never really even needs to care about the whole\n  revision chain \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really think in terms of deltas at all), but\n  it\u2019s also great because getting rid of the inflexible delta rules means\n  that git doesn\u2019t have any problems at all with merging two files together,\n  for example \u2014 there simply are no arbitrary *,v \u201crevision files\u201d that have\n  some hidden meaning.\nIt also means that the choice of deltas is a much more open-ended\n  question. If you limit the delta chain to just one file, you really don\u2019t\n  have a lot of choices on what to do about deltas, but in git, it really\n  can be a totally different issue.\nAnd this is where the really badly named --aggressive comes in. While\n  git generally tries to re-use delta information (because it\u2019s a good idea,\n  and it doesn\u2019t waste CPU time re-finding all the good deltas we found\n  earlier), sometimes you want to say \u201clet\u2019s start all over, with a blank\n  slate, and ignore all the previous delta information, and try to generate\n  a new set of deltas.\u201d\nSo --aggressive is not really about being aggressive, but about wasting\n  CPU time re-doing a decision we already did earlier!\nSometimes that is a good thing. Some import tools in particular could\n  generate really horribly bad deltas. Anything that uses git fast-import,\n  for example, likely doesn\u2019t have much of a great delta layout, so it might\n  be worth saying \u201cI want to start from a clean slate.\u201d\nBut almost always, in other cases, it\u2019s actually a really bad thing to do.\n  It\u2019s going to waste CPU time, and especially if you had actually done a\n  good job at deltaing earlier, the end result isn\u2019t going to re-use all\n  those good deltas you already found, so you\u2019ll actually end up with a\n  much worse end result too!\nI\u2019ll send a patch to Junio to just remove the git gc --aggressive\n  documentation. It can be useful, but it generally is useful only when you\n  really understand at a very deep level what it\u2019s doing, and that\n  documentation doesn\u2019t help you do that.\nGenerally, doing incremental git gc is the right approach, and better\n  than doing git gc --aggressive. It\u2019s going to re-use old deltas, and\n  when those old deltas can\u2019t be found (the reason for doing incremental GC\n  in the first place!) it\u2019s going to create new ones.\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s definitely true that an \u201cinitial import of a long\n  and involved history\u201d is a point where it can be worth spending a lot of\n  time finding the really good deltas. Then, every user ever after (as\n  long as they don\u2019t use git gc --aggressive to undo it!) will get the\n  advantage of that one-time event. So especially for big projects with a\n  long history, it\u2019s probably worth doing some extra work, telling the delta\n  finding code to go wild.\nSo the equivalent of git gc --aggressive \u2014 but done properly \u2014 is to\n  do (overnight) something like\ngit repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250\n\nwhere that depth thing is just about how deep the delta chains can be\n  (make them longer for old history \u2014 it\u2019s worth the space overhead), and\n  the window thing is about how big an object window we want each delta\n  candidate to scan.\nAnd here, you might well want to add the -f flag (which is the \u201cdrop all\n  old deltas,\u201d since you now are actually trying to make sure that this one\n  actually finds good candidates.\nAnd then it\u2019s going to take forever and a day (i.e., a \u201cdo it overnight\u201d\n  thing). But the end result is that everybody downstream from that\n  repository will get much better packs, without having to spend any effort\n  on it themselves.\n          Linus"}]}

The resulting\npackfile will be compressed, but will not be optimal. Frontends which have efficient access to all revisions of a\nsingle file (for example reading an RCS/CVS ,v file) can choose\nto supply all revisions of that file as a sequence of consecutive blob commands.  This allows fast-import to deltify the different file\nrevisions against each other, saving space in the final packfile.\nMarks can be used to later identify individual file revisions during\na sequence of commit commands. The packfile(s) created by fast-import do not encourage good disk access\npatterns.  This is caused by fast-import writing the data in the order\nit is received on standard input, while Git typically organizes\ndata within packfiles to make the most recent (current tip) data\nappear before historical data.  Git also clusters commits together,\nspeeding up revision traversal through better cache locality.

For example, this configuration: [man]\n\t\tviewer = konqueror\n\t\tviewer = woman will try to use konqueror first. But this may fail (for example, if\nDISPLAY is not set) and in that case emacs' woman mode will be tried. If everything fails, or if no viewer is configured, the viewer specified\nin the GIT_MAN_VIEWER environment variable will be tried.  If that\nfails too, the man program will be tried anyway. man.<tool>.path You can explicitly provide a full path to your preferred man viewer by\nsetting the configuration variable man.<tool>.path . For example, you\ncan configure the absolute path to konqueror by setting man.konqueror.path . Otherwise, git help assumes the tool is\navailable in PATH. man.<tool>.cmd When the man viewer, specified by the man.viewer configuration\nvariables, is not among the supported ones, then the corresponding man.<tool>.cmd configuration variable will be looked up. If this\nvariable exists then the specified tool will be treated as a custom\ncommand and a shell eval will be used to run the command with the man\npage passed as arguments. Note about konqueror When konqueror is specified in the man.viewer configuration\nvariable, we launch kfmclient to try to open the man page on an\nalready opened konqueror in a new tab if possible. For consistency, we also try such a trick if man.konqueror.path is\nset to something like A_PATH_TO/konqueror . That means we will try to\nlaunch A_PATH_TO/kfmclient instead. If you really want to use konqueror , then you can use something like\nthe following: [man]\n\t\tviewer = konq\n\n\t[man \"konq\"]\n\t\tcmd = A_PATH_TO/konqueror Note about git config --global Note that all these configuration variables should probably be set\nusing the --global flag, for example like this: $ git config --global help.format web\n$ git config --global web.browser firefox as they are probably more user specific than repository specific.\nSee git-config for more information about this."}]}

I will start with the first three, since these are the modes you'll usually encounter. After that you'll find a nice little a bonus, so stay tuned.\n\nLet's assume you have a repository with a history akin to this:\n7e05a95  (HEAD -> main) Update a\ne62add5  Update b\nca9ae0a  Update a\n9b6060d  Add c\neebe372  Add b\n947586a  Add a\n\nWhere the latest commit (7e05a95) contains these changes:\ndiff --git a/a b/a\nindex b66ba06..28b68e2 100644\n--- a/a\n+++ b/a\n@@ -1 +1 @@\n-new content\n+new new content\n\nNow what would happen when you run git reset with the various different modes? Let's find out!\nsoft\nWhen using git reset --soft HEAD~1 you will remove the last commit from the current branch, but the file changes will stay in your working tree. Also, the changes will stay on your index, so following with a git commit will create a commit with the exact same changes as the commit you \"removed\" before.\nHow would this look like in practice? Like this:\n> git reset --soft HEAD^ # Assuming HEAD points at 7e05a95\n> git status\nOn branch main\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage)\n    modified:   a\n\nAs you see the changes in file a are on the index, and ready to be committed again.\nmixed\nThis is the default mode and quite similar to soft. When \"removing\" a commit with git reset HEAD~1 you will still keep the changes in your working tree but not on the index; so if you want to \"redo\" the commit, you will have to add the changes (git add) before commiting.\nIn practice the result might look like this:\n> git reset --mixed HEAD^ # Assuming HEAD points at 7e05a95\n> git status\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n    modified:   a\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\nThe changes of file a are still there but they're not on the index.\nhard\nWhen using git reset --hard HEAD~1 you will lose all uncommited changes and all untracked files in addition to the changes introduced in the last commit. The changes won't stay in your working tree so doing a git status command will tell you that you don't have any changes in your repository.\nTread carefully with this one. If you accidentally remove uncommited changes which were never tracked by git (speak: committed or at least added to the index), you have no way of getting them back using git.\nA practical example might look like this:\n> git reset --hard HEAD^ # Assuming HEAD points at 7e05a95\n> git status\nOn branch main\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\nAs you can see, no changes remain. Assuming you also had some uncommitted changes in the file b these would be lost too!\n> echo 'some uncommitted changes' > b\n> git status\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n    modified:   b\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\n> git reset --hard HEAD^ # Assuming HEAD points at 7e05a95\n> git status\nOn branch main\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\nBonus\nkeep\ngit reset --keep HEAD~1 is an interesting and useful one. It only resets the files which are different between the current HEAD and the given commit. It aborts the reset if one or more of these files has uncommited changes. It basically acts as a safer version of hard.\nLet's revisit the example from before, where you had some uncommitted changes in b:\n> echo 'some uncommitted changes' > b\n> git status\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n    modified:   b\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\n> git reset --keep HEAD^ # Assuming HEAD points at 7e05a95\n> git status\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n    modified:   b\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\nYou removed the changes in file a but retained the uncommitted changes in file b!\nSo to reiterate: \"hard\" will remove all changes while \"keep\" only removes changes from the reset commit(s).\n\nEach of these modes is explained in depths in the git reset documentation.\nNote\nWhen doing git reset to remove a commit the commit isn't really lost, there just is no reference pointing to it or any of it's children. You can still recover a commit which was \"deleted\" with git reset by finding it's SHA-1 key, for example with a command such as git reflog."}]}

The difference arises when you're pushing more than one branch with a single git push.\nIn a nutshell, the optional + gives you finer control than -f does: if you're pushing more than one ref at a time, the + allows you to specify which of the pushed refs get force-pushed, whereas --force (or -f) applies to all the refs that are getting pushed.\nMore details\nWhat the git-push man page tells you\nThe most basic form of git push that involve one or more refspec(s) is\ngit push <repository> <refspec>...\n\nThe form that the <refspec>... argument must satisfy is described in the git-push man page thus:\n\n<refspec>...\nSpecify what destination ref to update with what source object. The\nformat of a `<refspec>` parameter is an optional plus `+`, followed by\nthe source object `<src>`, followed by a colon `:`, followed by the\ndestination ref `<dst>`.\n\n\nSo, just to be clear, the syntax for <refspec> is\n[+]<src>[:<dest>]\n\nIf :<dst> is omitted, the same ref as <src> will be updated... unless the remote.<repository>.push entry (if any) in your Git config says otherwise.\nFurther down in the git-push man page, you find\n\nBy having the optional leading +, you can tell Git to update the <dst>\n  ref even if it is not allowed by default (e.g., it is not a\n  fast-forward.) This does not attempt to merge <src> into <dst>.\n\nAnd still further down:\n\nNote that --force applies to all the refs that are pushed, hence\n  using it with push.default set to matching or with multiple push\n  destinations configured with remote.*.push may overwrite refs other\n  than the current branch (including local refs that are strictly behind\n  their remote counterpart). To force a push to only one branch, use a +\n  in front of the refspec to push (e.g git push origin +master to force\n  a push to the master branch).\n\nExample\nConsider a local repo with two branches, master and develop, which you want to push (with a single git push command) to an origin remote.\n\ngit push origin master develop will push both branches, but neither will get force-pushed.\ngit push origin +master develop will push both branches, but only master will get force-pushed. \ngit push origin master +develop , conversely, will push both branches, but only develop will get force-pushed.\ngit push origin +master +develop will force-push both branches. It's an exact equivalent to git push -f origin master develop."}]}

(I mean the ones on the remote central bare repository, not on local clone repository.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The remote repo should be configured to run gc as needed after a commit is added. See the documentation of gc.auto in git-gc and git-config man pages.\nHowever, a remote repo shouldn't need all that much garbage collection, since it will rarely have dangling (unreachable) commits. These usually result from things like branch deletion and rebasing, which typically happen only in local repos.\nSo gc is needed more for repacking, which is for saving storage space rather than removing actual garbage. The gc.auto variable is sufficient for taking care of this.\n\nUpdate in 2024:\nGarbage in GitHub repos is commonplace nowadays, because the typical PR workflow involves a lot of force-pushing and rebasing.\nHowever, you can't influence GC in a remote repo, GitHub or not. You can do it only if you have shell access on the remote system that's hosting the repo. In other words, garbage collection has to be a local operation on the machine where the repo is located.\nGitHub does do GC, but it happens invisibly. Sometimes this has unfortunate and surprising consequences when best practices aren't being followed. For example, it's possible to refer to the commit hash of a PR in a source-based dependency in another project, while waiting for a PR to be accepted upstream. If that PR branch is subsequently rebased, the source dependency will continue working for a while, because the dangling commit can still be fetched if its hash is known.\nHowever, when GH does get around to doing GC on the repo, the other project's build will suddenly break with a \"missing reference\" error because the commit no longer exists in the dependency's repo. This can be very mystifying, especially if the person who set up the source dependency is no longer around. What's more, it can be extremely hard to figure out what the missing hash was originally referring to, because it's no longer part of any branch.\nIf you're very lucky, the commit will still exist in someone's clone of the repo that hasn't been garbage-collected, and the reflogs can be used to find out what branch the commit was originally in. The source dependency can then be updated to use the rebased version of the PR, or can be dropped altogether if the PR has now been merged.\nThe moral of the story: be very careful when referring to commits in PRs. They aren't stable and can disappear without warning."}]}

The hash that you see here is the same that you'd see by going into the submodule's directory1 and checking the latest commit (with git log  or git rev-parse HEAD)\ngit ls-tree HEAD shows the target status, which is not necessarily the current one. If you want to update your submodules so that they correspond to the specified version, you have to use git submodule update.\n\nWhat can cause the current and target status to differ?\nThe typical situation in which they differ is when you git checkout another branch/tag/commit, or you use git pull to update your current branch. Both these commands will cause HEAD to be updated to the corresponding commit. Now, if this commit specifies that your submodule has to use a different version, git submodule status will still show the old one, but the target shown by git ls-tree HEAD will already be the new one.\nIs there a simpler way of noticing that they are out of sync?\nCheck the output of git submodule status. As the manual explains, if there's a + before the hash, it means that the currently checked-out version and the target one are different.\nHow do I bring them back in sync?\nBy running git submodule update: the new submodule will be loaded, and both commands will indicate the same commit.\nExample\nFor example, let's say that in our repo we have a submodule called base.\nThe output of git submodule status is (notice the +):\n\n+059ca6c4940813aa956e8668cb0af27efa189b22 base (release-1.2)\n\nAnd the output of git ls-tree HEAD is\n\n160000 commit fbc447ef9468def36cf4089094d6960cc51618b3  base\n\nAs we can see, the hashes are different. In fact, the + had already informed us.\nNow, if we type git submodule update, it says:\n\nSubmodule path 'base': checked out 'fbc447ef9468def36cf4089094d6960cc51618b3'\n\nAnd now all the commands we can use (git submodule status, git ls-tree HEAD, and git log from inside base) indicate fbc447ef9468def36cf4089094d6960cc51618b3, and there's no + in front of it in the output of git submodule status. If we run git submodule update again, nothing happens, as everything is already up to date, and there isn't even any output.\n\n1: You have to be careful when you check the commit of a submodule, because it's tricky: to find the last commit that was made in submodule base you can't use git log base, you have to enter that directory (cd base) and then run git log from there. The reason is that the first command lists the commits of the \"main\" repository which set a new version of the submodule, and these commits are completely independent from those that were made inside the submodule."}]}

Please review https://sandofsky.com/workflow/git-workflow/, avoid the 'no-ff' with its \"checkpoint commits\" that break bisect or blame, and carefully consider whether it should be your default approach for master.\n\n(From nvie.com, Vincent Driessen, post \"A successful Git branching model\")\n\nIncorporating a finished feature on develop\nFinished features may be merged into the develop branch to add them to the upcoming release:\n$ git checkout develop\nSwitched to branch 'develop'\n$ git merge --no-ff myfeature\nUpdating ea1b82a..05e9557\n(Summary of changes)\n$ git branch -d myfeature\nDeleted branch myfeature (was 05e9557).\n$ git push origin develop\n\nThe --no-ff flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.\n\nJakub Nar\u0119bski also mentions the config merge.ff:\n\nBy default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded.\nWhen set to false, this variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the --no-ff option from the command line).\nWhen set to 'only', only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the --ff-only option from the command line).\n\n\nThe fast-forward is the default because:\n\nshort-lived branches are very easy to create and use in Git\nshort-lived branches often isolate many commits that can be reorganized freely within that branch\nthose commits are actually part of the main branch: once reorganized, the main branch is fast-forwarded to include them.\n\nBut if you anticipate an iterative workflow on one topic/feature branch (i.e., I merge, then I go back to this feature branch and add some more commits), then it is useful to include only the merge in the main branch, rather than all the intermediate commits of the feature branch.\nIn this case, you can end up setting this kind of config file:\n[branch \"master\"]\n# This is the list of cmdline options that should be added to git-merge \n# when I merge commits into the master branch.\n             \n# The option --no-commit instructs git not to commit the merge\n# by default. This allows me to do some final adjustment to the commit log\n# message before it gets commited. I often use this to add extra info to\n# the merge message or rewrite my local branch names in the commit message\n# to branch names that are more understandable to the casual reader of the git log.\n\n# Option --no-ff instructs git to always record a merge commit, even if\n# the branch being merged into can be fast-forwarded. This is often the\n# case when you create a short-lived topic branch which tracks master, do\n# some changes on the topic branch and then merge the changes into the\n# master which remained unchanged while you were doing your work on the\n# topic branch. In this case the master branch can be fast-forwarded (that\n# is the tip of the master branch can be updated to point to the tip of\n# the topic branch) and this is what git does by default. With --no-ff\n# option set, git creates a real merge commit which records the fact that\n# another branch was merged. I find this easier to understand and read in\n# the log.\n\nmergeoptions = --no-commit --no-ff\n\n\nThe OP adds in the comments:\n\nI see some sense in fast-forward for [short-lived] branches, but making it the default action means that git assumes you... often have [short-lived] branches. Reasonable?\n\nJefromi answers:\n\nI think the lifetime of branches varies greatly from user to user. Among experienced users, though, there's probably a tendency to have far more short-lived branches.\nTo me, a short-lived branch is one that I create in order to make a certain operation easier (rebasing, likely, or quick patching and testing), and then immediately delete once I'm done.\nThat means it likely should be absorbed into the topic branch it forked from, and the topic branch will be merged as one branch. No one needs to know what I did internally in order to create the series of commits implementing that given feature.\n\nMore generally, I add:\n\nit really depends on your development workflow:\n\nif it is linear, one branch makes sense.\nIf you need to isolate features and work on them for a long period of time and repeatedly merge them, several branches make sense.\n\nSee \"When should you branch?\"\n\nActually, when you consider the Mercurial branch model, it is at its core one branch per repository (even though you can create anonymous heads, bookmarks and even named branches)\nSee \"Git and Mercurial - Compare and Contrast\".\n\nMercurial, by default, uses anonymous lightweight codelines, which in its terminology are called \"heads\".\nGit uses lightweight named branches, with injective mapping to map names of branches in remote repository to names of remote-tracking branches.\nGit \"forces\" you to name branches (well, with the exception of a single unnamed branch, which is a situation called a \"detached HEAD\"), but I think this works better with branch-heavy workflows such as topic branch workflow, meaning multiple branches in a single repository paradigm."}]}

In the past both terms were used pretty much interchangeably by the users and the GitHub's very own documentation. This is reflected by some of the answers and comments here that explain the subtle differences between those terms and when the one was preferred over the other. The difference were always subtle, e.g. like the issue tracker being part of the project but not part of the repository which might be thought of as a strictly git thing etc.\nNot any more.\nCurrently repos and projects refer to a different kinds of entities that have separate APIs:\n\nhttps://developer.github.com/v3/repos/\nhttps://developer.github.com/v3/projects/\n\nSince then it is no longer correct to call the repo a project or vice versa.\nNote that it is often confused in the official documentation and it is unfortunate that a term that was already widely used has been chosen as the name of the new entity but this is the case and we have to live with that.\nThe consequence is that repos and projects are usually confused and every time you read about GitHub projects you have to wonder if it's really about the projects or about repos. Had they chosen some other name or an abbreviation like \"proj\" then we could know that what is discussed is the new type of entity, a precise object with concrete properties, or a general speaking repo-like projectish kind of thingy.\nThe term that is usually unambiguous is \"project board\".\nWhat can we learn from the API\nThe first endpoint in the documentation of the Projects API:\n\nhttps://developer.github.com/v3/projects/#list-repository-projects\n\nis described as: List repository projects. It means that a repository can have many projects. So those two cannot mean the same thing. It includes Response if projects are disabled:\n{\n  \"message\": \"Projects are disabled for this repo\",\n  \"documentation_url\": \"https://developer.github.com/v3\"\n}\n\nwhich means that some repos can have projects disabled. Again, those cannot be the same thing when a repo can have projects disabled.\nThere are some other interesting endpoints:\n\nCreate a repository project - POST /repos/:owner/:repo/projects\nCreate an organization project - POST /orgs/:org/projects\n\nbut there is no:\n\nCreate a user's project - POST /users/:user/projects\n\nWhich leads us to another difference:\n1. Repositories can belong to users or organizations2. Projects can belong to repositories or organizations\nor, more importantly:\n1. Projects can belong to repositories but not the other way around2. Projects can belong to organizations but not to users3. Repositories can belong to organizations and to users\nSee also:\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/\n\nI know it's confusing. I tried to explain it as precisely as I could."}]}

As a clone, it will contain all the branches in the main repo at the time you made the fork.\nEach branch within the fork and/or in the main repo can correspond to several kinds of things, depending on how you want to work. Each branch could refer to a version of the project but can also correspond to different channels of development, like hotfixes or experimental work.\nThe pull request (in the GitHub ecosystem) corresponds to the task. Every time I want to contribute an isolated finished task to the main repo, I create a pull request corresponding to the commits made in that task. These commits are pulled from either my fork or my branch to the main repo.\nA commit is a set of changes to the code. This is one of the most interesting things about Git. You don't transfer files, you transfer logs of changes."}]}

I'd think not, but thought I'd ask.  Basically, I'd like to check in my home directory config files (e.g. .emacs) which should be common across all of the machines I work on, but have a second repository for local files (e.g. .emacs.local), which contains machine-specific configurations.  The only way I can think of to do that is to have the local config in a subdirectory and ignore that subdirectory from the main git repository.  Any other ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This article covers this relatively well:\nhttps://github.com/rrrene/gitscm-next/blob/master/app/views/blog/progit/2010-04-11-environment.markdown\nBasically if you're working from the command-line this is simpler than you might guess. Suppose you want 2 git repos:\n.gitone\n.gittwo\n\nYou could set them up like so:\ngit init .\nmv .git .gitone\ngit init .\nmv .git .gittwo\n\nYou could add a file and commit it to only one like so:\ngit --git-dir=.gitone add test.txt\ngit --git-dir=.gitone commit -m \"Test\"\n\nSo the options for git come first, then the command, then the git command's options. You could easily enough alias a git command like:\n#!/bin/sh\nalias gitone='git --git-dir=.gitone'\nalias gittwo='git --git-dir=.gittwo'\n\nSo you can commit to one or the other with a bit less typing, like gitone commit -m \"blah\".\nWhat appears to get trickier is ignores. Since .gitignore normally sits in the project root, you'd need to find a way to switch this as well without switching the entire root. Or, you could use .git/info/exclude, but all the ignores you perform then won't be committed or pushed - which could screw up other users. Others using either repo might push a .gitignore, which may cause conflicts. It's not clear to me the best way to resolve these issues.\nIf you prefer GUI tools like TortoiseGit you'd also have some challenges. You could write a small script that renames .gitone or .gittwo to .git temporarily so these tools' assumptions are met.\nAvoiding 2 Repos\nYou can accomplish a similar result by composing your branch, although you're still doing a fair bit of dancing to keep things going.\nSuppose you have local files, like system-specific settings in the original question. You want to keep them out of your commits to other developers, but, you want them committed somewhere, as they're either essential to run, or, could be critical in debugging\nInstead of 2 git repos you can do the following:\ngit checkout main\ngit checkout -b local\ngit add -A .\ngit commit -m \"local changes\"\ngit checkout main\ngit checkout -b chris\ngit checkout -b dev\ngit merge local\n\nSo, you started with local changes, that you put out on a branch called \"local\". You're never going to push this branch to the remote.\nYou set those changes aside, then made another branch off of main named with what you'll be pushing, for example named after you (in my case, \"chris\").\nSo far you have the 2 distinct branches, but, you don't have a way for them to work together. You make a third, Composed Branch - dev here is a composition of chris and local.\nYou do your dev in dev, then when it's time to push, you:\ngit checkout chris\ngit add -A .\ngit commit -m \"My commit message\"\ngit push\n\ngit checkout dev\ngit merge chris\n\nThis pushes the changes, clean out on chris, then comes back to dev and recomposes the branch. chris continues to remain squeaky clean, your meaningful changes are pushed, and the stuff you wanted to preserve locally stays safe on the local branch.\nMore special scenarios:\nPushing your local branch\nSuppose you wanted to push your \"local\" branch afterall, for example if there's no important secrets in it and you're using git partly as a backup. Easy fix, just name the branch something long and very clear so no dev pulls it and expects it to work for them, like chris-local-settings. If you dislike typing that long name over and over (and tab completion isn't enough), branching the branch is super cheap:\ngit checkout chris-local-settings\ngit checkout -b local\n\nGenerated files\nSuppose your local branch is more complex, and there are generated files that keep creating clutter. You need them to debug, but you never want to push them to your clean branch filled with just your, non-generated changes.\nYour generated files probably follow a pattern, or if they don't, you probably have some say in where they generate when so they do follow a pattern. For example, if all you generated files appear in a folder named \"bin\" and you've just finished some important coding:\ngit checkout local\ncd bin\ngit add -A .\ngit commit -m \"Generated files\"\ncd ..\ngit checkout chris\ngit commit -m \"Commit message about my clean handwritten changes\"\ngit push\ngit checkout dev\ngit merge local\ngit merge chris\n\nBecause you know all your generated files are in the bin folder, you can just cd over and git add there. You cleanly dump them off in local, then back out to root and commit the rest to your clean branch. You then recompose your dev branch.\nIf in the future you need to know what your build looked like for a given day and time, you can recompose another branch, or, step back in time on the dev branch. That said, I usually throw out and recompose the dev branch often in my build, so, it has no history unfortunately:\nImagine some changes happened on main, and I need to verify they work before potentially poisoning my build:\ngit checkout main\ngit pull\ngit checkout dev\ngit checkout -b test\ngit merge main\n\nNow I'd run tests to verify the build. If they go poorly:\ngit checkout dev\ngit branch -D test\n\nAnd off I go to tell whoever last pushed to main, they broke it. Now I'm safe in dev away from the broken main branch. Or, if the tests go well:\ngit checkout chris\ngit merge main\ngit push\ngit branch -D dev\ngit checkout -b dev\ngit merge local\n\nThat turns dev into a clean merge of chris, which has the latest on main merged in, so those pulling the chris branch get what's latest on main plus my changes and nothing more - meaning I'm not throwing extra merge conflicts at them. But it does mean I keep losing history on dev."}]}

New output variations in plumbing commands can be introduced via new options, but that can not introduce any problems for programs that have already been written against older versions (they would not be using the new options, since they did not exist (or at least were not used) at the time the script was written).\nUnfortunately the \u2018everyday\u2019 Git commands are the \u2018porcelain\u2019 commands, so most Git users may not be familiar with with the plumbing commands. The distinction between porcelain and plumbing command is made in the main git manpage (see subsections titled High-level commands (porcelain) and Low-level commands (plumbing).\n\nTo find out about uncomitted changes, you will likely need git diff-index (compare index (and maybe tracked bits of working tree) against some other treeish (e.g. HEAD)), maybe git diff-files (compare working tree against index), and possibly git ls-files (list files; e.g. list untracked, unignored files).\n(Note that in the below commands, HEAD -- is used instead of HEAD because otherwise the command fails if there is a file named HEAD.)\nTo check whether a repository has staged changes (not yet committed) use this:\ngit diff-index --quiet --cached HEAD --\n\n\nIf it exits with 0 then there were no differences (1 means there were differences).\n\nTo check whether a working tree has changes that could be staged:\ngit diff-files --quiet\n\n\nThe exit code is the same as for git diff-index (0 == no differences; 1 == differences).\n\nTo check whether the combination of the index and the tracked files in the working tree have changes with respect to HEAD:\ngit diff-index --quiet HEAD --\n\n\nThis is like a combination of the previous two. One prime difference is that it will still report \u201cno differences\u201d if you have a staged change that you have \u201cundone\u201d in the working tree (gone back to the contents that are in HEAD). In this same situation, the two separate commands would both return reports of \u201cdifferences present\u201d.\n\nYou also mentioned untracked files. You might mean \u201cuntracked and unignored\u201d, or you might mean just plain \u201cuntracked\u201d (including ignored files). Either way, git ls-files is the tool for the job:\nFor \u201cuntracked\u201d (will include ignored files, if present):\ngit ls-files --others\n\nFor \u201cuntracked and unignored\u201d:\ngit ls-files --exclude-standard --others\n\nMy first thought is to just check whether these commands have output:\ntest -z \"$(git ls-files --others)\"\n\n\nIf it exits with 0 then there are no untracked files. If it exits with 1 then there are untracked files.\n\nThere is a small chance that this will translate abnormal exits from git ls-files into \u201cno untracked files\u201d reports (both result in non-zero exits of the above command). A bit more robust version might look like this:\nu=\"$(git ls-files --others)\" && test -z \"$u\"\n\n\nThe idea is the same as the previous command, but it allows unexpected errors from git ls-files to propagate out. In this case a non-zero exit could mean \u201cthere are untracked files\u201d or it could mean an error occurred. If you want the \u201cerror\u201d results combined with the \u201cno untracked files\u201d result instead, use test -n \"$u\" (where exit of 0 means \u201csome untracked files\u201d, and non-zero means error or \u201cno untracked files\u201d).\n\nAnother idea is to use --error-unmatch to cause a non-zero exit when there are no untracked files. This also runs the risk of conflating \u201cno untracked files\u201d\u00a0(exit 1) with \u201can error occurred\u201d (exit non-zero, but probably 128). But checking for 0 vs. 1 vs. non-zero exit codes is probably fairly robust:\ngit ls-files --others --error-unmatch . >/dev/null 2>&1; ec=$?\nif test \"$ec\" = 0; then\n    echo some untracked files\nelif test \"$ec\" = 1; then\n    echo no untracked files\nelse\n    echo error from ls-files\nfi\n\nAny of the above git ls-files examples can take --exclude-standard if you want to consider only untracked and unignored files."}]}

The command is inside the command: $(#command).\n\nNow let's use them:\necho $VAR1\n# some string\necho \"This is my variable $VAR1\"\n# This is my variable some string\necho \"This is my variable ${VAR1}\"\n# This is my variable some string\necho ${VAR1}\n# some string\necho \"Error code ${VAR2}A\"\n# Error code 23A\necho \"Error code $VAR2A\"\n# Error code --- Note: the variable $VAR2A dosn't exist\necho \"Error code ${VAR2}${VAR1}\"\n# Error code 23some string\necho VAR1\n# VAR1\necho \"VAR1\"\n# VAR1\n\nThis illustrates the difference between the different forms, but in general, you reference a variable's value with $+variable-name.
